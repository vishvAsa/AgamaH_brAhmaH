FOREWORD 

## Context
Śrī Rāmānuja wrote nine works in Sanskrit on the philosophy of Visiṣṭādvaita.[^1] Of these, the Vedārtha-sangraha occupies a unique place inasmuch as this work takes the place of a commentary on the Upanisads, though not in a conventional sense or form. The work mirrors a total vision of the Upanisads, discussing all the controversial texts in a relevent, coherent manner. It is in fact an independent exposition of the philosophy of the Upanishads. Prof. M. Hiriyanna describes it as 'an independent treatise explaining in a masterly way his philosophic position, and pointing out the basis for it in the Upanisads'.[^2] Sudarsana-sūri, the celebrated commentator on the Sri-bhāṣya and the Vedartha-sangraha, says that the work was expounded in the form of a lecture before Lord Srinivāsa at Tirumalai.[^3] Thus it is his testament at the feet of the Lord whom he served throughout his life. Śrī Rāmānuja refers to this work more than once in his Śrī-bhāṣya. 

## Sources
The Vedartha-sangraha is written in a lucid, vigorous prose without the usual divisions of chapters, but the structure of the thesis is developed in a scientific manner. Śrī Rāmānuja refers in this work to ancient teachers of theistic tradition, Bodhayana, Taika, Dramida, Guhadeva, Kapardin and Bharuci, besides his own teacher, Śri Yamunācārya.[^4] Ţanka and Dramida are quoted profusely to support his interpretation.

He takes abundant help from the Brahmasūtras, the Rāmāyaṇa, the Mahābhārata, the Viṣṇu-purāṇa, the Manusmṛti and other genuine smrtis in the exposition of his philosophy. 

## tattva, hita, puruṣārtha
At the outset Sri Ramanuja states that the Upanisads, which lay down the welfare of the whole world, move around three fundamental notions: 

1) A seeker must acquire a true knowledge of the individual self and the Supreme; 
2) he must devote himself to meditation, worship and the adoration of the Supreme; 
3) this knowledge with discipline leads him to the realization of the Supreme. 

To put it briefly, the first affirms the *tattva* or the nature of the Reality, the second declares the *hita* or the means, and the third states the *puruṣārtha* or the ideal of human endeavour. 

## bhēda vs abhēda
A chief difficulty in understanding the meaning of the Upanisads arises in determining the relation of Brahman to the individual self on the one hand, and to the non-sentient world on the other. There are some texts which declare that the world is only an appearance in the ultimate analysis. There are other texts which affirm that the world is not an appearance, but real and distinct. 

Bhartṛprapañca, who was anterior to Sri Sankara, held that the self and the universe are identical with and different from Brahman, the triad constituting a unity in variety. That is to say, that the reality is at once one as Brahman and many as the self and the world. For example, an ocean consists of water, foam, waves, etc. As the water is real, so also are the foam, waves, etc. The world, which is a part and parcel of Brahman, is necessarily real. The import of all this is that according to this view the Upanisads teach the eternal difference and identity between Brahman on the one hand, and the self and the world on the other.[^2-1] 

[^2-1]: See Śrī Sankara's commentary on Br. V. I, and Prof. Hiriyanna's monograph on Bhartṛprapañca. 

[[iii]]

Sri Sankara rejects the view of Bhatṛprapañca, because mutually contradictory attributes cannot be predicated of one and the same thing. According to Sri Sankara the passages which affirm manifoldness and reality of the world do not embody the essential teaching of the Upanisads. It is a concession made to the empirical view that demands a real world having causal connection with time-space. Since variety is but an appearance having no foundation in the ultimate Reality, the true essential doctrine of the Upaniṣads, according to him, is only pure unity. The individual self is nothing but Brahman itself appearing as finite due to limiting adjuncts which are superimposed on it. 

## ghaṭikā-śrutis
Śrī Rāmānuja also attempts to systamatize the philosophy of the Upanisads, taking the cue from the ancient theistic philosophers. He recognises three lines of thought in the Upanisads concerning the relation between Brahman, the self and the world: 

1) Passages which declare difference of nature between the world, the self and Brahman. Here the world is the non-sentient matter (acit) which is the object of experience, the self is the experiencing conscious subject (cit), and Brahman, the absolute ruling principle.[^3-1] These may be named analytical texts. 

2) Passages which teach that Brahman is the inner self of all entities which constitute his body. For instance,  
  > 'He who dwells in the earth and within the earth,  
  whom the earth does not know, whose body the earth is,  
  and who rules the earth within, he is thy Self, the ruler within, the immortal' etc. (Bṛ. III, vii, 3-23). 
  
  These are called ghataka-śrutis or mediating texts. 

3) Passages which proclaim the unity of Brahman with the world in its causal as well as effected aspect. The famous text, "That thou art, O Śvetaketu' (Chā. VI 2-8) comes under this category. These may be termed as synthetic passages. 

[^1]: See Sve. 1, 9-10, IV. 9-10, Mahā. XI. 3. 

[[iv]]

Śrī Rāmānuja lays down that the interpretation of the various passages must be such that they are not made to contradict each other, and not a single passage should be so interpreted as to be divested of its primary significance.[^4-1] 

[^4-1]: नानारूपाणां वाक्यानाम् अविरोधो मुख्यार्थापरित्यागश् च यथा संभवति तथा वर्णनीयम् । (Vs. par, 115) 

The first group of texts distinguishes Brahman from the world and the individual selves. In a way it emphasizes the transcendent character of Brahman.  

The second group of texts declares Brahman to be the inner self of all entities. Neither the individual self nor the world can exist by itself. They are inseparably connected with Brahman as his body, and thus are controlled by him. These texts teach duality in so far as distinction is made between body and self, and unity in so far as the self, the substantive element, predominates over and controls the body, its attribute.  

The last group of texts aim at proclaiming the non-dual character of Brahman who alone constitutes the ultimate Reality. The self and the world, though distinct from each other and real, have a different value. They only exist as a mode or attribute of Brahman. They are comprehended in the reality of Brahman. They exist because Brahman exists. 

On this principle of interpretation, Sri Ramanuja recognizes that  
the passages declaring distinction between Brahman, the world and the self,  
and those affirming Brahman to be the same in the causal as well as effected aspects,  
do not in any way contradict the mediating passages which declare that the individual selves and the world form the body of Brahman,  
and they in their causal state do not admit the distinction of names and forms while in the effected state they possess distinct character. 

## apr̥thak-siddhi
The notion of unity may be illustrated by the example, 'A purple robe'. Here purpleness is quite different from robe. The latter is a substance while the former is an attribute. This integral and essential relation is not found in the case of a man wearing a wrist-watch. If the former relation is inseparable (aprthak-siddhi), the latter is separable and external.  

A word signifying attribute does not stop after denoting the usual meaning, but extends till it reaches the substantive. This is the true significance of an attribute.  

The individual selves and the world constitute the body of Brahman who is their inner self. Brahman is the integral principle without whom neither the self nor the world can exist. Hence all names finally denote him. 

## sāmānādhikaranya
The way in which Śrī Rāmānuja interprets the famous text, "That thou art' (Tat tvam asi) is unique. This is done by means of co-ordinate predication (sāmānādhikaranya).  

In a co-ordinate predication,  
the identity of the substantive should not be established through the rejection of the natural significance of co-ordinate terms. The indentical import of terms taken in their natural signification should be brought out.  
The Mahabhāṣya of Patañjali defines co-ordinate predication thus: 

> The signification of an identical entity by several terms  
which are applied to that entity on different grounds is co-ordinate predication.

> भिन्न-प्रवृत्ति-निमित्तानां शब्दानाम्  
एकस्मिन्नर्थे वृत्तिस् **सामानाधिकरण्यम्** । (Vs. par. 24) 


In such a proposition the attributes not only should be distinct from each other but also different from the substance, though inseparable from it. In the illustration of a 'Purple robe', the basic substance is one and the same, though 'purpleness' and 'robeness' are different from it as well as from each other. That is how the unity of a 'Purple robe' is established. In the co-ordinate predication asserting indentity between 'that' and 'thou', Brahman himself with the self as his mode, having the self as his body, is pointed out. 

[[vi]]

The term 'thou', which usually stands for the self here, stands for Brahman ("that") who is the indweller of the self and of whom the self is the mode as a constituent of his body.  
The term 'thou' does not mean the physical body or the individual self.  

Since Brahman has interpenetrated all matter and self,  
'thou' signifies Brahman in the ultimate analysis.  
The term 'that' signifies Brahman himself as the ground of the universe and the soul of all individual selves.  
Hence in the identity of "that' and 'thou' there is no rejection of the specific connotation of the co-ordinate terms.  

The upshot of the dictum is that the individual selves and the world, which are distinct and real attributes, are comprehended in Brahman. Brahman as the inner self of the jiva-Brahman as the ground of the universe are one. 

The central principle is that whatever exists as an attribute of a substance, that being inseparable from the substance is one with that substance. 

Thus Sri Ramanuja upholds all the three streams of thoughts in the Upanisads, namely, unity, plurality and both. He himself clinches the argument: 

> 'We uphold unity because Brahman alone exists with all other entities as his modes.  
> We uphold both unity and plurality,  
> as the one Brahman himself has all the physical and spiritual entities as his modes  
> and thus exists qualified by a plurality.  
> We uphold plurality as the three entitiesthe individual selves, the world and the supreme Lordare mutually distinct in their substantive nature and attributes  
> and there is no mutual transposition of their characteristics."

> सर्वशरीरतया सर्व-प्रकारं ब्रह्मैव अवस्थितम् इति,  
> अभेद: समर्थितः;  
> एकम् एव ब्रह्म नाना-भूत-चिद्-अचिद्-वस्तु-प्रकारं  
> नानात्वेन अवस्थितम् इति भेदाभेदौ;  
> अ-चिद्-वस्तुनश् च चिद्-वस्तुनश् च ईश्वरस्य च  
> स्वरूप-स्वभाव-वैलक्षण्यात् असङ्कराच्च भेद समर्थितः ।  
> ( Vs pa-. 117)

## Progression to bhakti
The summum bonum is the vision of the supreme Person, known as Brahman or Sriman-Nārāyaṇa. The chief obstacle in the path towards perfection is the accumulation of evil tendencies. These can be destroyed only by the cultivation of good tendencies. 

This is followed by self-surrender which generates an inclination towards life divine.  
Then one has to acquire the knowledge of the Reality from the scriptures aided by the holy teachers.  

Then the practice of virtues like the control of mind and sense, austerity, purity, non-violence, compassion, etc., becomes easy.  
Nitya and naimittika duties are to be performed, and prohibited actions are to be avoidedthe whole conduct being conceived as the worship of God. 

God, the embodiment of love and compassion, showers his grace on the aspirant, which puts an end to all his obstacles. 

Finally bhakti rises which is an enjoyment of bliss in itself.  

Bhakti is but meditation which has assumed the character of the most vivid and direct perception of the Supreme. 

## Relation to karma and jñāna
Śrī Rāmānuja, like his predecessor and teacher, Śrī Yāmunācārya, declares that bhakti succeeds the twofold training of the mind by karma and jñāna.  

> 1 ज्ञानयोग-कर्मयोग-संस्कृतान्तः-करणस्य इत्य् अर्थः । ( Vs. par 127)viii 

Karma-yoga is performance of duties of one's station in life with no thought of reaping any personal benefit in the spirit of Gītā's teachings. Karma that is performed in this manner cleanses the heart. 

Jñana-yoga, which immediately follows the previous discipline, is meditation upon the individual self as distinct from matter like body, mind, etc., with which it is associated. It helps the aspirant to determine the true nature of one's self in relation to the Supreme. He realizes that he is absolutely subservient to God. 

The discipline does not stop with the knowledge of one's self alone. It is incomplete without the knowledge of God.+++(5)+++ 

## upāsana
Here the word bhakti does not connote the popular sense in which it is understood. Bhakti-yoga is loving meditation upon God. When the meditation attains the form of 'firm remembrance' (dhruvānusmṛtiḥ) characterised by intense love, the vision of the Supreme is attained. It must be mentioned here that the final release is attained after the dissolution of the body. One endowed with such bhakti and self-surrender attains the fitness to earn the grace of the Lord. This bhakti itself is upāsana or vidyā mentioned in the Upanisads. It is same as knowledge spoken of in the śrutis: 'One who knows Brahman attains the Supreme' (Tai. II, 1), ‘He who knows him becomes immortal here' (Pu. 20), and 'He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman' (Mu. III, ii, 9). 

As the vision of the Supreme is not possible through ordinary means of perception, he can be seen only through bhakti, which is a unique form of knowledge. This is in consonance with the Gita declaration, 'I am attainable only through undivided bhakti' (XI, 54). 

## Goal/ puruśārtha
III 

It was already mentioned that the ideal to be realized is the vision of the Supreme. It is an experience of absolute peace, perfection, bliss and freedom, untouched by the cosmic limitations of space and time. Sri Ramanuja is accused of having given a 'picturesque description' of the ideal realm. But a little insight into the spirit of his writings reveals that the ideal is not such a fairyland as it is made out to be. 

The domain, he points out, is of the nature of pure immutable sattva. It is transcendent without the taints of the material gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas. Similarly the individual self also, in the state of moksa, gives up its material body and assumes a transcendent form. The substance of suddhasattva is common to God, the self and the realm of the ideal known as nitya-vibhūti. The first chapter of the Kauṣitaki [[ix]] Upanisad gives a figurative account of the pilgrim's progress till he reaches the feet of God. 

The individual self is the essence of knowledge. This knowledge in its attributive aspect (dharma-bhūta-jñāna) gets more or less contracted in samsara, but it expands infinitely in the state of mokṣa. It becomes all-knowing and enjoys perfect bliss and love in divine communion. In short it is an ineffable enjoyment. In this natural state it yields its spirit to the will, glory and adoration of God. Śrī Rāmānuja characterises this state as 'ananya-prayojana' having no other end except itself. In this ideal place there is no break in the enjoyment of divine communion. 

## dāsya
Śrī Rāmānuja is not unaware of the criticism that there is subservience to and dependence upon God in his conception of mokṣa. The critics say that subordination in any form cannot conduce to the joy of self. The divine fetters are not less strong to bind. Further Manu says that servitude is a dog's life. Śrī Rāmānuja effectively meets this criticism in his characteristic way. He enunciates a principle 'that what an individual pursues as a desirable end depends upon what he conceives himself to be'.[^9-1] Different people pursue different and mutually conflicting values. Hence the notion that independence is happiness proceeds from the misconception that one is identical with the body, mind, etc. 


[^9-1]: आत्माभिमानो यादृशः तद्-अनुगुणैव पुरुषार्थ-प्रतीति: । ( Vs.par. 245 ) 

This attachment to the body is a sort of dependence itself. Instead of dependence on God, it is dependence on matter. The metaphysical fact is that he is not the body, and consequently there must be something else with which his self is related. There cannot be relation of the principal entity and the subsidiary (śeṣin and seṣa) between any finite objects. The only object with which such a relation can exist is God. Hence dependence on anything other than God is painful and subservience to God is joy and freedom. Similarly bondage is indeed a dog's life when one serves those who are unworthy of service. The only entity which is worthy of love, adoration and service is God. Sri Ramanuja clinches the issue by quoting a text, 'He is to be served by all'.1 The emancipation consists in service of God, and true bondage is independence of God and service of body. 

## Raghavachar
Sri S. S. Raghavachar, who is a deep student of philosophy, especially of Visiṣṭadvaita, has achieved a large measure of success in his difficult task of translation. The learned translator has done a signal service to the students of philosophy by translating this masterly treatise of Śrī Rāmānuja. I am sure that it will prove to be of great help to the students of Indian philosophy.
