2.1.8 उपसंहारदर्शनाधिकरणम् The view that that which is a cause depends upon extraneous aids to give rise to its effect and Brahman being devoid of any extraneous aid can not be the cause of the world is wrong. It is because just as milk turns into curd without the need for any extraneous aid, in the same way Brahman without depending upon any extraneous aid could be the cause of the world.
