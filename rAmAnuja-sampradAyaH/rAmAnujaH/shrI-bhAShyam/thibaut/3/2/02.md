2. And some (state the soul to be) the shaper; and sons, and so on.

And the followers of one śākhā state in their text that the dreaming soul is the shaper of its desires: 'He, the person who is awake in those who sleep, shaping one desired thing (kāma) after the other.' The term 'kāma' there denotes not mere desires, but such things as sons and the like which are objects of desire. For sons and so on are introduced as 'kāmas' in previous passages: 'Ask for all kāmas according to thy wish'; 'Choose sons and grandsons living a hundred years' (Ka. Up. I, 1, 25; 23). The individual soul thus creates chariots, and so on, in its dreams. That the soul has the power of realising all its

wishes is known from the declaration of Prajāpati. It is therefore able to create, even in the absence of special instruments.--This view is set aside by the next Sūtra.
