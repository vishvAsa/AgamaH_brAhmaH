2. And on account of the non-perception (of truth on the part) of others.

The 'and' in the Sūtra has the force of 'but,' being meant to dispel the doubt raised. There are many other authors of Smr̥tis, such as Manu, who through the power of their meditation had attained insight into the highest truth, and of whom it is known from Scripture that the purport of their teaching was a salutary medicine to the whole world ('whatever Manu said that was medicine'). Now, as these R̥shis did not see truth in the way of Kapila, we conclude that Kapila's view, which contradicts Scripture, is founded on error, and cannot therefore be used to modify the sense of the Vedānta-texts.--Here finishes the adhikaraṇa treating of 'Smr̥ti.'
