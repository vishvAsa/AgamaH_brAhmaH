## shRngeri influence
Svami Brahmananda Sarasvati, popularly known as “Gurudeva”, was a rare Sanyasi.

He was requested many times to get installed as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmatha but kept refusing. On one occasion, just a day before the installation ceremony was to happen, he slipped away and disappeared. He was not interested. Finally, when he was about 70 years of age, he  agreed, and Jyotirmatha was revived in 1941 after a gap of 165 years.

It is noteworthy that today, Shankaracharya of the 3 Peethas (including the North which is disputed) are his disciples’ disciples.

And he himself in young age was initiated in the Sanyasa by a Svami from Shringeri Peeth.

This way, Shringeri’s lineage can be seen today as being the present Shankaracharyas of all the four.

## Vasudevananda Sarasvati
Why do RSS and BJP call Svami Vasudevananda Sarasvati Ji as the Jyotirmatha Shankaracharya, despite the court finding him not to be valid, and not even qualified for the post? Why do RSS and BJP call him Shankaracharya, despite the Court even directing the government to stop such people from calling themselves Shankaracharya, and despite none of the 3 Peethas recognizing him as one? Why is he placed on the Ayodhya temple board and no authentic Shankaracharya?

(Here is the operative part of the order. Interestingly, the writer of this is the same Judge, who also presided over the Ram Janma Bhumi order)

Neither the Court, nor the other 3 Peethas, nor the Kashi Vidvat Parishad have found Svami Vasudevanand ji to be the valid Shankaracharya of Jyotirmatha. What’s more, court has declared him to not have the qualification for that position - since he was not even a Sanyasi! Then why do BJP and RSS insist on still legitimizing him (illegally) as Shankaracharya? Why is he called Shankaracharya of Jyotirmatha by Chmpat Rai? Why is he on the RJB temple board? What’s BJP/RSS locus standi on the matter?

It would be one thing to state - 

> “as on date of 15-Jan-2024, there is no Shankaracharya of Jyotirmatha Peeth - since a consensus candidate is yet to be agreed who is ratified by the 3 Peethas and KVP, as per the Supreme Court order.”

It is however quite different to say, as BJP/RSS doing, that Svami Vasudevananda is Shankaracharya of Jyotirmatha. He is not. Court has explicitly declared him invalid and found him unqualified. Why openly disobeying Court and the three Peethas?
