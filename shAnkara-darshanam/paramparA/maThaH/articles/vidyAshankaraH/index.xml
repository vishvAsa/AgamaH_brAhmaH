      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Jyotirmaṭha Śaṅkarācārya Lineage in the 20th Century&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Vidyāśaṅkar Sundareśan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This page was first born in response to the INDOLOGY listserv discussion (January 19, 1998) about the [Śaṅkarācārya of the North], and has been updated a few times since then. Barring fresh developments in future, this version (July 2000) will be final.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is currently a succession dispute at the Jyotirmaṭha Śaṅkarācārya seat, the origin of which dates back to the year 1953. Till recently, the two major rivals were Svāmī Svarūpānanda Sarasvatī (who is also the Śaṅkarācārya of Dvārakā in the west) and Svāmī Vāsudevānanda Sarasvatī. Since 1993-4, another Saṃnyāsin named Mādhava Āśrama has been a third claimant to the Jyotirmaṭha title.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Subject: Real history of the Kanchi math (Re: Former President Inaugurates&amp;hellip;) Celebrations&lt;br&gt;&#xA;From: &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:vidya@cco.caltech.edu&#34;&gt;vidya@cco.caltech.edu&lt;/a&gt; (Vidyasankar Sundaresan)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Date: 3 Aug 1994 04:05:16 GMT&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both this post and a previous one by Bon Giovanni have raised questions of  historicity of Adi Sankaracharya and the Kanchi math. This is not a new  question. It is generally accepted as tradition that Adi Sankaracharya,  the famous Advaita philosopher, founded four maths (monasteries) at  Sringeri, Puri, Dwaraka and Badrinath; that he ascended the famous  sarvagna-pitha in Kashmir, and finally passed away near Kedarnath. None of  the four recognized mathas claims jurisdiction over the other three. However,  the Kanchi math claims that Sankaracharya established a fifth math in  Kanchi, with jurisdiction over the recognized four mathas; that  Sankaracharya ascended a sarvagna-pitha not in Kashmir, but at Kanchi, and  that he passed away not in Kedarnath, but at Kanchi. These and other such  claims have been widely publicized by the followers of the Kanchi math  with the direct participation of and encouragement from the heads of the  Kanchi math, including the recently departed centenarian Sri  Chandrasekharendra Saraswati (C.S., for short) and his successor Sri  Jayendra Saraswati (J.S.).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shaṅkaravijaya History</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conflicting hagiographies and history: The place of Śaṅkaravijaya texts in Advaita tradition&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Vidyasankar Sundaresan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-texts-and-their-cultural-context&#34;&gt;THE TEXTS AND THEIR CULTURAL CONTEXT&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many legendary stories are current about Śaṅkarācārya, the teacher of Advaita Vedānta, some of which are recorded in texts known as the Śaṅkaravijayas.&amp;rsquo; The oft-quoted dates for Śaṅkara (788-820 CE) are found in one of these hagio graphic texts, but internal evidence from Śaṅkara&amp;rsquo;s undisputed works suggests a date earlier in the eighth century. The Madhavīya Śaṅkaravijaya, which informs most accounts of Śaṅkara&amp;rsquo;s life in both popular and scholarly literature (Bader 1991; Lorenzen 1983), is traditionally attributed to Vidyāraṇya, who lived in the fourteenth century. This text, along with another Śaṅkaravijaya by Anantānandagiri, was consulted in one of the earliest studies of Hinduism (Wilson 1977). The latter text is often mistakenly attributed to Anandagiri, a thirteenth-century author of ṭīkās (subcommentaries) on Śaṅkara&amp;rsquo;s works, but I show here that this text clearly dates from a much later period. Mādhavīya has two commentaries, Ḍiṇḍima by Dhanapatisūrin and Advaitarajyalakṣmi by Acyutarāya. Other important texts include Cidvilāsa&amp;rsquo;s Śaṅkaravijaya Vilāsa, Sadānanda&amp;rsquo;s Śaṅkaravijaya Sāra, on which Dhanapatisūrin wrote a commentary called Dundubhi, Rājacūḍāmaṇi dīkṣita&amp;rsquo;s Śaṅkarābhyudaya, and Govinda nātha&amp;rsquo;s Śaṅkarācāryacarita.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
