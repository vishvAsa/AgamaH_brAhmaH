## Intro
Swami Narasimha Saraswati and the Shringeri Guru Parampara: An Inseparable Connection


Swami Narasimha Saraswati, regarded as an incarnation of Lord Dattatreya, is one of the most influential Acharyas of the Advaita Sampradaya. It would not be an exaggeration to state that the Smārta tradition thrived in Uttara-Karnataka and Maharashtra largely due to the efforts of this great Mahātman.

As the Shringeri Sannidhanam is currently visiting Ganagapura, which houses the Nirguna Padukas of Shri Narasimha Saraswati Maharaj, it is an opportune moment to explore the Guru Parampara of Swami Maharaj.

The Guru Parampara of Swami Narasimha Saraswati is described in the 12th chapter of the Guru Charitra. Below are the Marathi verses:

आदिपीठ ‘शंकर’ गुरु । तदनंतर ‘विष्णु’ गुरु ।त्यानंतर ‘चतुर्वक्‍त्र’ गुरु । हें मूळपीठ अवधारीं ॥९॥

तदनंतर ‘वसिष्‍ठ’ गुरु । तेथोनि ‘शक्ति’, ‘पराशरु’ ।त्याचा शिष्य ‘व्यास’ थोरु । जो कां अवतार विष्णूचा ॥११०॥

तयापासूनि ‘शुक’ गुरु जाण । ‘गौडपादाचार्य’ सगुण ।आचार्य ‘गोविंद’ तयाहून । पुढें आचार्य तो ‘शंकर’ जाहला ॥११॥

तदनंतर ‘विश्वरुपाचार्य’ । पुढें ‘ज्ञानबोधीगिरिय’ ।त्याचा शिष्य ‘सिंहगिरिय’ । ‘ईश्वरतीर्थ’ पुढें झाले ॥१२॥

तदनंतर ‘नृसिंहतीर्थ’ । पुढें शिष्य ‘विद्यातीर्थ’ ।‘शिवतीर्थ’, ‘भारतीतीर्थ’ । गुरुसंतति अवधारीं ॥१३॥

मग तयापासोनि । ‘विद्यारण्य’ श्रीपादमुनि ।‘विद्यातीर्थ’ म्हणोनि । पुढें झाला परियेसा ॥१४॥

त्याचा शिष्य ‘मळियानंद’ । ‘देवतीर्थसरस्वती’ वृंद।तेथोनि ‘सरस्वतीयादवेंद्र’ । गुरुपीठ येणेंपरी ॥१५॥

यादवेंद्र मुनीचा शिष्य । तोचि ‘कृष्णसरस्वती’ विशेष ।बहुकाळींचा संन्यासी । म्हणोनि विशेष मानिती ॥१६॥

येणेंपरी श्रीगुरुनाथ । आश्रम घेती चतुर्थ ।संन्यासमार्गस्थापनार्थ । श्रीनृसिंहसरस्वती ॥१७॥

Based on these verses, the Guru Parampara can be listed as follows:

1. Shiva
2. Vishnu
3. Chaturmukha Brahma
4. Vasishtha
5. Shakti
6. Parashara
7. Vyasa
8. Shuka
9. Gaudapada
10. Govinda Bhagavatpada
11. Adi Shankaracharya
12. Vishvarupa Acharya
13. Jnana-Bodhagiri
14. Simhagiri
15. Ishvara Tirtha
16. Narasimha Tirtha
17. Vidya Tirtha
18. Shiva Tirtha
19. Bharati Tirtha
20. Vidyaranya
21. Vidya Tirtha
22. Maliyānanda Saraswati
23. Deva Tirtha Saraswati
24. Yadavendra Saraswati
25. Krishna Saraswati
26. Narasimha Saraswati

It is beyond doubt that the Guru Parampara mentioned in Guru Charitra (GCP) is essentially the Shringeri Guru Parampara (SGP). A comparison of the two reveals that they are identical up to Swami Vidyaranya, with only minor differences:

1. After Vishvarupa Acharya, SGP includes Nityabodhaghana, Jnanaghana, Jnanottama, and Jnanagiri, whereas GCP seems to consolidate these as Jnana-Bodha-Giri.

2. GCP includes an additional name, Shiva Tirtha, between Vidya Tirtha and Bharati Tirtha.

Thus, in addition to blessing the Advaita tradition with luminaries such as Vidya Tirtha, Bharati Tirtha, and Vidyaranya, the Shringeri Guru Parampara has also given us Swami Narasimha Saraswati Maharaj, who remains deeply revered by the āstikas of Maharashtra and Uttara-Karnataka.

It is heartening to see this oneness further reinforced by the visit of the Sringeri Jagadgurus to Ganagapura and their grand reception by the āstikas of the region.

Guru Parampara of Shri Nrusimha Saraswati:  A Corroborative Evidence from Bihar


Shri Nrusimha Saraswati Maharaj, revered as an incarnation of Lord Dattatreya, played a pivotal role in reviving Sanatana Dharma and instilling dharmacharana among the masses. As described in the Guru Charitra, he tirelessly traversed the land, guiding people on the path of dharma. His spiritual legacy extends far beyond Maharashtra and Karnataka, leaving an indelible mark on seekers across the country. By his divine grace, I recently came across compelling evidence that further substantiates the breadth of his influence. As a humble offering at his sacred Padukas, I wish to share this discovery, which not only corroborates the Guru Parampara mentioned in Guru Charitra but also suggestive of his far-reaching spiritual lineage.

In a previous post, we examined the Guru Parampara of Shri Nrusimha Saraswati Maharaj as mentioned in the 12th chapter of Guru Charitra. There, we established that Swami Maharaj’s Guru Parampara aligns with the Shringeri Guru Parampara. An additional point relevant to this discussion is the mention of Maharaj’s shishyas (disciples) in the 13th chapter of Guru Charitra. The text briefly describes them as follows:

असतां तेथें वर्तमानीं । प्रख्यात झाली महिमा सगुणी । शिष्य झाले अपार मुनि । मुख्य माधवसरस्वती ॥१८॥

तया शिष्यांचीं नामें सांगतां । विस्तार होईल बहु कथा । प्रख्यात असती नामें सात । सांगेन ऐक एकचित्तें ॥१९॥

बाळसरस्वती कृष्णसरस्वती । उपेंद्र-माधवसरस्वती । पांचवा असे आणीक यति । सदानंदसरस्वती देखा ॥२०॥

ज्ञानज्योतिसरस्वती एक । सातवा सिद्ध आपण ऐक । अपार होते शिष्य आणिक । एकाहूनि एक श्रेष्‍ठ पैं ॥२१॥

These verses indicate that Shri Nrusimha Saraswati Maharaj had seven principal disciples: Bala Saraswati, Krishna Saraswati, Upendra Saraswati, Madhava Saraswati, Sadananda Saraswati, Jnanajyoti Saraswati, and Siddha (the narrator of Guru Charitra). Among them, Shri Madhava Saraswati was his foremost disciple—an important detail to bear in mind.

Now, coming to the main topic, there exists a Shakta Upasana manual titled Gadyavallari, authored by a certain Mallikarjuna Yogindra. A manuscript of this work, dated to 1736, was discovered in Sitamarhi, Bihar. At the beginning of the text, the author lists the Guru Parampara of his lineage. It is well known that this parampara corresponds precisely with the Shringeri Guru Parampara and has been cited in historical accounts of the Matha. However, what is truly remarkable is that the name of Shri Nrusimha Saraswati Maharaj—along with that of his disciple Madhava(endra) Saraswati—appears in this lineage!

The manuscript excerpts are attached in the comments, but the Guru Parampara mentioned in Gadyavallari is as follows:

1. Shiva
2. Vishnu
3. Brahma
4. Vasishtha
5. Shakti
6. Parashara
7. Vyasa
8. Shuka
9. Gaudapada
10. Govindapada
11. Shankara Bhagavatpada
12. Vishvarupacharya
13. Bodhghanacharya
14. Jnanaghanacharya
15. Jnanottama Shivacharya
16. Jnanagiri
17. Simhagiri
18. Ishvara Tirtha
19. Vidya Tirtha Shiva (Vidya Tirtha is also known as Vidya Shankara Tirtha and Vidya Tirtha Maheshvara, justifying the suffix ‘Shiva’ in his name)
20. Bharati Tirtha
21. Vidyaranya
22. Malayananda Saraswati
23. Deva Tirtha Saraswati
24. Yadavendra Saraswati
25. ____ Saraswati [A missing name, likely due to manuscript damage]
26. Nrusimha Saraswati
27. Madhavendra Saraswati
28. Mallikarjuna Yogindra

Upon comparing this list with the Guru Parampara described in Guru Charitra’s 12th chapter, it is evident that the Nrusimha Saraswati mentioned here is the same revered Acharya whom we recognize as the incarnation of Lord Dattatreya. The 25th name preceding Nrusimha Saraswati can reasonably be inferred as Krishna Saraswati, based on Guru Charitra’s description. Similarly, Madhavendra Saraswati can be identified with Madhava Saraswati, the prime disciple of Swami Nrusimha Saraswati.

This finding from Bihar—geographically distant from Maharashtra and Karnataka—provides independent verification of the Guru Parampara detailed in Guru Charitra. Not only does it reinforce the lineage of Shri Nrusimha Saraswati Maharaj, but it also strengthens the fact that his Guru Parampara is identical to the Shringeri Guru Parampara. Additionally, this evidence suggests that Shri Nrusimha Saraswati was a Devi Upasaka and that his discipleship extended as far as Bihar.

It is our utmost fortune to consider ourselves humble devotees of Shri Nrusimha Saraswati Maharaj and followers of the sacred lineage of Shringeri. May we always remain worthy recipients of their divine grace.
