17. For (there is) also (a class of good works) other than this, according to some. (There is agreement) of both (teachers) (as to the fate of those works.)

'For also one other than this,' i.e. there is also a class of good works different from works of permanent obligation, viz. those good works which are performed with a view to a fruit. Of those latter works the passage quoted above from some Śākhā ('His friends enter on his good works') teaches the application. And first of those works Sūtra 14 teaches that, in the same way as evil deeds, they do not cling to the doer or else are destroyed. Both teachers, Jaimini as well as Bādarāyaṇa, are agreed that such works, undertaken for the fulfilment of some special wish, do not contribute towards the origination of true knowledge.
