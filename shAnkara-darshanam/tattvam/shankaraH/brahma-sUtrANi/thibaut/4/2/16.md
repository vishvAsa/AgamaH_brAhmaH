16. (There is absolute) non-division (from Brahman, of the parts merged in it); according to scriptural declaration.

When the parts of him who knows are merged in Brahman, is there a remainder (which is not so merged), as in the case of other men; or is there no such remainder? As the merging of him also who knows falls under the general heading of merging, it might be assumed that of him also there remains a potential body, and the Sūtrakāra therefore teaches expressly that the elements, &c., of him who knows enter into the relation of (absolute) non-division from Brahman.

On what ground?

Because scripture declares this. For after having taught the dissolution of the parts, the text continues, 'Their name and form are broken, and people speak of the person only; and he becomes without parts and immortal' (Pr. Up. VI, 5). And when parts that are due to nescience are dissolved

through knowledge it is not possible that a remainder should be left. The parts therefore enter into absolute non-division from Brahman.
