12. For this reason Bādarāyaṇa (opines that the released person is) of both kinds; as in the case of the twelve days' sacrifice.

The teacher Bādarāyaṇa, again, thinks that for this reason, i.e. because scripture contains indications of both kinds, the proper conclusion is that the released person exists in both

conditions. When he wishes to have a body, he appears with one; when he wishes to be disembodied, he is without one. For he has various wishes, and all his wishes are realised.--'As in the case of the twelve days' sacrifice.' As the soma sacrifice extending over twelve days may be viewed either as a sattra or as an ahīna sacrifice, because both alternatives are indicated by scriptural passages [^sbe38331.htmfn_234]; so it is here also.
