12. To the highest (Brahman) (the souls are led); Jaimini (opines); owing to this being the principal sense (of the word 'Brahman').

The teacher Jaimini is of opinion that the passage, 'He leads them to Brahman,' refers to the highest Brahman. For the highest Brahman constitutes the principal, primary sense, of the word 'Brahman,' which denotes the lower Brahman only in a secondary, metaphorical way. And where both senses are possible, the primary sense has to be preferred.
