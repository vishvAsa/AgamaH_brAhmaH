15. (It is not so) (because the prāṇas are connected) with that to which the prāṇas belong (i.e. the individual soul), (a thing we know) from scripture.

Although there are divinities guiding the prāṇas, yet we learn from scripture that those prāṇas are connected with the embodied soul which is the Lord of the aggregate of

instruments of action. The following passage, e.g. 'where the sight has entered into the void there is the person of the eye; the eye itself is the instrument of seeing. He who knows, let me smell this, he is the Self; the nose is the instrument of smelling, declares that the prāṇas are connected with the embodied soul only. Moreover the plurality of the divinities guiding the organs renders it impossible that they should be the enjoyers in this body. For that there is in this body only one embodied enjoyer is understood from the possibility of the recognition of identity and so on [^fn_61].

[^fn_61]: 93:1 Yohaṁ rūpam adrākshaṁ sohaṁ sr̥ṇomīty ekasyaiva pratyabhijñānam pratisamdhānam. Go Ān.
