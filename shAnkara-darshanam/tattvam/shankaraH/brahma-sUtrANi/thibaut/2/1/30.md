30. And (the highest divinity is) endowed with all (powers) because that is seen (from Scripture).

We have stated that this multiform world of effects is possible to Brahman, because, although one only, it is endowed with various powers.

How then--it may be asked--do you know that the highest Brahman is endowed with various powers?-He is, we reply, endowed with all powers, 'because that is seen.' For various scriptural passages declare that the highest divinity possesses all powers, 'He to whom all actions, all desires, all odours, all tastes belong, he who embraces all this, who never speaks, and is

never surprised' (Cḥ. Up. III, 14, 4); 'He who desires what is true and imagines what is true' (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 7, 1); 'He who knows all (in its totality), and cognizes all (in its detail') (Mu. Up. I,1,9); 'By the command of that Imperishable, O Gārgī, sun and moon stand apart' (Br̥. Up. III, 8, 9); and other similar passages.
