23. Moreover Smr̥ti also speaks of him (i.e. of the prājña. Self as being the universal light).

Moreover that aspect of the prājña Self is spoken of in Smr̥ti also, viz. in the Bhagavad Gītā (XV, 6, 12), 'Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the fire illumines that; having gone into which men do not return, that is my highest seat.' And 'The light which abiding in the sun illumines the whole world, and that which is in the moon and that which is in the fire, all that light know to be mine.'
