11. This (supporting can), on account of the command (attributed to the Imperishable, be the work of the highest Lord only).

The supporting of all things up to ether is the work of the highest Lord only.

Why?

On account of the command.

For the sacred text speaks of a command ('By the command of that akshara, O Gārgī, sun and moon stand apart!' III, 8, 9), and command can be the work of the highest Lord only, not of the non-intelligent pradhāna. For non-intelligent causes such as clay and the like are not capable of command, with reference to their effects, such as jars and the like.
