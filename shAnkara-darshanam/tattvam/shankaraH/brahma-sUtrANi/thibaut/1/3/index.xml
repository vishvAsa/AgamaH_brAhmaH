Up. II, 2, 5), &amp;lsquo;He in whom the heaven, the earth, and the sky are woven, the mind also with all the vital airs, know him alone as the Self, and leave off other words! He is the bridge of the Immortal.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of its being designated as that to which the Released have to resort.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the abode of heaven, earth, and so on, we have to understand the highest Brahman for that reason also that we find it denoted as that to which the Released have to resort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The conception that the body and other things contained in the sphere of the Not-self are our Self, constitutes Nescience; from it there spring desires with regard to whatever promotes the well-being of the body and so on, and aversions with regard to whatever tends to injure it; there further arise fear and confusion when we observe anything threatening to destroy it. All this constitutes an endless series of the most manifold evils with which we all are acquainted. Regarding those on the other hand who have freed themselves from the stains of Nescience desire aversion and so on, it is said that they have to resort to that, viz. the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;amp;c. which forms the topic of discussion. For the text, after having said, &amp;lsquo;The fetter of the heart is broken, all doubts are solved, all his works perish when He has been beheld who is the higher and the lower&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. II, 2, 8), later on remarks, &amp;lsquo;The wise man freed from name and form goes to the divine Person who is greater than the great&amp;rsquo; (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8). That Brahman is that which is to be resorted to by the released, is known from other scriptural passages, such as &amp;lsquo;When all desires which once entered his heart are undone then does the mortal become immortal, then he obtains Brahman&amp;rsquo; (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 7). Of the pradhāna and similar entities, on the other hand, it is not known from any source that they are to be resorted to by the released. Moreover, the text (in the passage, &amp;lsquo;Know him alone as the Self and leave off other words&amp;rsquo;) declares that the knowledge of the abode of heaven and earth, &amp;amp;c. is connected with the leaving off of all speech; a condition which, according to another scriptural passage, attaches to (the knowledge of) Brahman; cp. Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 21, &amp;lsquo;Let a wise Brāhmaṇa, after he has discovered him, practise wisdom. Let him not seek after many words, for that is mere weariness of the tongue.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hence he (the sūtrakāra) says that that which is inferred, i.e. the pradhāna assumed by the Sānkhya-smr̥ti, is not to be accepted as the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;amp;c.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On account of the declaration of difference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The passage &amp;lsquo;Know him alone as the Self&amp;rsquo; moreover implies a declaration of difference, viz. of the difference of the object of knowledge and the knower. Here the individual soul as being that which is desirous of release is the knower, and consequently Brahman, which is denoted by the word &amp;lsquo;self&amp;rsquo; and represented as the object of knowledge, is understood to be the abode of heaven, earth, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. I, 1, 3) in which the knowledge of everything is declared to be dependent on the knowledge of one thing. For all this (i.e. the entire world) becomes known if Brahman the Self of all is known, not if only the individual soul is known.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Mu. Up. III, 1, 1). This passage describes the two states of mere standing, i.e. mere presence, and of eating, the clause, &amp;lsquo;One of them eats the sweet fruit,&amp;rsquo; referring to the eating, i.e. the fruition of the results of works,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VII, 23; 24), &amp;lsquo;That which is much (bhūman) we must desire to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sir, I desire to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is what is much (bhūman). Where one sees something else, hears something else, understands something else, that is the Little.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And on account of the agreement of the attributes (mentioned in the text).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The attributes, moreover, which the sacred text ascribes to the bhūman agree well with the highest Self. The passage, &amp;lsquo;Where one sees nothing else, hears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is the bhūman,&amp;rsquo; gives us to understand that in the bhūman the ordinary activities of seeing and so on are absent; and that this is characteristic of the highest Self, we know from another scriptural passage, viz. &amp;lsquo;But when the Self only is all this, how should he see another?&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c. (Br̥. Up. IV, 5, 15). What is said about the absence of the activities of seeing and so on in the state of deep sleep (Pra. Up. IV, 2) is said with the intention of declaring the non-attachedness of the Self, not of describing the nature of the prāṇa; for the highest Self (not the vital air) is the topic of that passage. The bliss also of which Scripture speaks as connected with that state is mentioned only in order to show that bliss constitutes the nature of the Self. For Scripture says (Br̥. Up. IV, 3, 32), &amp;lsquo;This is his highest bliss. All other creatures live on a small portion of that bliss.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. III, 8, 7; 8). &amp;lsquo;In what then is the ether woven, like warp and woof?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He said: O Gārgī, the Brāhmaṇas call this the akshara (the Imperishable). It is neither coarse nor fine,&amp;rsquo; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here the doubt arises whether the word &amp;lsquo;akshara&amp;rsquo; means &amp;lsquo;syllable&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;the highest Lord.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pūrvapakshin maintains that the word &amp;lsquo;akshara&amp;rsquo; means &amp;lsquo;syllable&amp;rsquo; merely, because it has, in such terms as akshara-samāmnāya, the meaning of &amp;lsquo;syllable;&amp;rsquo; because we have no right to disregard the settled meaning of a word; and because another scriptural passage also (&amp;lsquo;The syllable Om is all this,&amp;rsquo; Cḥ. Up. II, 23, 4) declares a syllable, represented as the object of devotion, to be the Self of all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

V, 2) the general topic of discussion is set forth in the words, &amp;lsquo;O Satyakāma, the syllable Om is the highest and also the other Brahman; therefore he who knows it arrives by the same means at one of the two.&amp;rsquo; The text then goes on, &amp;lsquo;Again, he who meditates with this syllable Om of three mātrās on the highest Person,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now what exists within that small ether that is to be sought for, that is to be understood,&amp;rsquo; &amp;amp;c.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here the doubt arises whether the small ether within the small lotus of the heart of which Scripture speaks, is the elemental ether, or the individual soul (vijñānātman), or the highest Self. This doubt is caused by the words &amp;rsquo;ether&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;city of Brahman.&amp;rsquo; For the word &amp;rsquo;ether,&amp;rsquo; in the first place, is known to be used in the sense of elemental ether as well as of highest Brahman. Hence the doubt whether the small ether of the text be the elemental ether or the highest ether, i. e. Brahman. In explanation of the expression &amp;lsquo;city of Brahman,&amp;rsquo; in the second place, it might be said either that the individual soul is here called Brahman and the body Brahman&amp;rsquo;s city, or else that the city of Brahman means the city of the highest Brahman.

Just as a dam stems the spreading water so that the boundaries of the fields are not confounded, so that Self acts like a limitary dam in order that these outer and inner worlds, and all the different castes and āśramas may not be confounded. In accordance with this our text declares that greatness, which is shown in the act of holding asunder, to belong to the small (ether) which forms the subject of discussion; and that such greatness is found in the highest Lord only, is seen from other scriptural passages, such as &amp;lsquo;By the command of that Imperishable, O Gārgī, sun and moon; are held apart&amp;quot;(Br̥.

As that remark calls for a refutation we point out that it has been refuted already, it having been shown&amp;ndash;under I, 2, 7&amp;ndash;that a relative smallness may be attributed to the Lord.

The teacher, Bādarāyaṇa, maintains the existence of the qualification on the part of the gods, &amp;amp;c. For, although the qualification of the gods cannot be admitted with reference to the madhu-vidyā, and similar topics of knowledge, in which the gods themselves are implicated, still they may be qualified for the pure knowledge of Brahman, qualification in general depending on the presence of desire, capability, &amp;amp;c. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Nor does the impossibility of qualification in certain cases interfere with the presence of qualification in those other cases where it is not impossible. To the case of the gods the same reasoning applies as to the case of men; for among men also, all are not qualified for everything, Brāhmaṇas, for instance, not for the rājasūya-sacrifice &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;35&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And because the kshattriyahood (of Jānaśruti) is understood from the inferential mark (supplied by his being mentioned) later on with Caitraratha (who was a kshattriya himself).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gānaśruti cannot have been a Śūdra by birth for that reason also that his being a kshattriya is understood from an inferential sign, viz. his being mentioned together (in one chapter) with the kshattriya Caitraratha Abhipratārin. For, later on, i.e. in the passage complementary to the saṁvarga-vidyā, a kshattriya Caitrarathi Abhipratārin is glorified, &amp;lsquo;Once while Śaunaka Kāpeya and Abhipratārin Kākshaseni were being waited on at their meal a religious student begged of them&amp;rsquo; (Cḥ. Up. IV, 3, 5). That this Abhipratārin was a Caitrarathi (i.e. a descendant of Citraratha) we have to infer from his connexion with a Kāpeya. For we know (from Śruti) about the connexion of Citraratha himself with the Kāpeyas (&amp;rsquo;the Kāpeyas made Citraratha perform that sacrifice;&amp;rsquo; Tāṇḍya. Br. XX, 12, 5), and as a rule sacrificers of one and the same family employ officiating priests of one and the same family. Moreover, as we understand from Scripture (&amp;lsquo;from him a Caitrarathi descended who was a prince &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rsquo;) that he (Caitraratha) was a prince, we must&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Compare, for instance, Śat. Br. XI, 5, 3, 13, &amp;lsquo;He initiated him as a pupil;&amp;rsquo; Cḥ. Up. VII, 1, 1, &amp;lsquo;Teach me, Sir! thus he approached him;&amp;rsquo; Pra. Up.

The prohibition of hearing the Veda is conveyed by the following passages: &amp;lsquo;The ears of him who hears the Veda are to be filled with (molten) lead and lac,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;For a Śūdra is (like) a cemetery, therefore (the Veda) is not to be read in the vicinity of a Śūdra.&amp;rsquo; From this latter passage the prohibition of studying the Veda results at once; for how should he study Scripture in whose vicinity it is not even to be read? There is, moreover, an express prohibition (of the Śūdras studying the Veda). &amp;lsquo;His tongue is to be slit if he pronounces it; his body is to be cut through if he preserves it.&amp;rsquo; The prohibitions of hearing and studying the Veda already imply the prohibition of the knowledge and performance of Vedic matters; there are, however, express prohibitions also, such as &amp;lsquo;he is not to impart knowledge to the Śūdra,&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;to the twice-born belong study, sacrifice, and the bestowal of gifts.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Up. VIII, 12, 3). Here the doubt arises whether the word &amp;rsquo;light&amp;rsquo; denotes the (physical) light, which is the object of sight and dispels darkness, or the highest Brahman.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(from name and form).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scripture says, &amp;lsquo;He who is called ether, (ākāśa) is the revealer of all forms and names. That within which these&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;forms and names are contained is the Brahman, the Immortal, the Self (Cḥ. Up. VIII, 14, 1).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There arising a doubt whether that which here is called ether is the highest Brahman or the ordinary elemental ether, the pūrvapakshin declares that the latter alternative is to be embraced, firstly, because it is founded on the conventional meaning of the word &amp;rsquo;ether;&amp;rsquo; and, secondly, because the circumstance of revealing names and forms can very well be reconciled with the elemental ether, as that which affords room (for all things). Moreover, the passage contains no clear indicatory mark of Brahman, such as creative power, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here the doubt arises, whether the passage merely aims at making an additional statement about the nature of the transmigrating soul (known already from other sources), or at establishing the nature of the non-transmigrating Self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
