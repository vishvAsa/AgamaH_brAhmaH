63. On account of the rectification.

The passage, 'From the seat of the Hotr̥ he sets right any mistake committed in the udgītha' (Cḥ. Up. I, 5, 5), declares that, owing to the might of the meditation on the unity of praṇava and udgītha, the Hotr̥ sets right any mistake he may commit in his work, by means of the work of the Hotr̥.

Now, as a meditation mentioned in one Veda is connected (with what is mentioned in another Veda) in the same way as a thing mentioned in another Veda, the above passage suggests the conclusion that all meditations on members of sacrificial acts--in whatever Veda they may be mentioned--have to be combined [^fn_179].

[^fn_179]: 282:1 A 'thing' belonging to the R̥g-veda, viz. the praṇava, is, according to the Cḥāndogya-passage, connected with the Sāma-veda meditation on the udgītha. Hence meditations also which belong to different Vedas may be combined; for there is no difference between them and things as far as connexion is concerned.
