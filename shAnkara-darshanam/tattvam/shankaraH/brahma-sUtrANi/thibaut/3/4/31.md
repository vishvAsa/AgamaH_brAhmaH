31. And hence also a scriptural passage as to non-proceeding according to liking.

There is also a scriptural passage prohibiting unlawful food, the purpose of which it is to stop procedure therein according to one's liking, viz. in the Saṁhitā of the Kaṭḥas, 'Therefore a Brāhmaṇa is not to drink spirits.' This text also is more appropriate if we take the passage, 'To him who knows this,' as an arthavāda.

Hence passages of that kind are arthavādas, not injunctions.
