39. Better than this is the other (state of belonging to an āśrama), on account of the indicatory marks.

'Than this,' i.e. 'than standing between,' a better means of knowledge it is to stand within one of the āśramas, since this is confirmed by Śruti and Smr̥ti. For scripture supplies an indicatory mark in the passage, 'On that path goes whoever knows Brahman and who has done holy

works (as prescribed for the āśramas) and obtained splendour' (Br̥. Up. IV, 4, 9); and Smr̥ti in the passage, 'Let a Brāhmaṇa stay not one day even outside the āśrama; having stayed outside for a year he goes to utter ruin.'
