11. But (caraṇa means) nothing but good and evil works; thus Bādari opines.

The teacher Bādari, however, thinks that the word 'caraṇa' denotes nothing else but good works and evil works. It means the same as anushṭḥāna (performance) or karman (work). For we see that the root car (to walk, to conduct oneself) is used in the general sense of acting. Of a man who performs holy works such as sacrifices, &c., people say in ordinary language, 'that excellent man walks in righteousness.' The word ācāra also denotes only a kind of religious duty. That works and caraṇa (conduct) are sometimes spoken of as different things is analogous to the distinction sometimes made between Brāhmaṇas and Parivrājakas [^fn_96]. We, therefore, decide that by men of good caraṇa are meant those whose works are worthy of praise, by men of evil caraṇa those whose works are worthy of blame.

[^fn_96]: 121:2 Although the latter are a mere sub-class of the former.
