## vidhu-shekhara-bhAratI
shrI vidhushekhara bhAratI of shRngeri pITha spread canards about some "dhanAkarShaNa-yantra" and shankarachArya statue at a certain specific location in tirupati temple - [TW](https://youtube.com/shorts/D740o7CHoGs?si=PCBJQhYoOYwc1UrH)  
(I confirmed with those with intimate access to the said areas that this is false.)

## kAnchi-maTha

### varadarAja temple founding
kAnchi-maTha followers claim that shankara built the varadarAja perumAL temple, as it exists today, and take a certain sculpture of a yati doing namaskAra to vyAsa as proof.

However, the said engraving is found in pillar in a maNDapa which was built post-aurangzeb invasion, by famous uttaradhimath sishays Sri krishnaji panth, Sri Babu raya of 18th century; as per records and clear inscriptions (including one from satyanAtha tIrtha).

The pillar itself clearly shows - 

- rAma + hanumanta
- kRShNa + bhIma
- vyAsa + a yati (presumably madhva)
- 2 (mAdhva) yatis (satyapUrNa, satyavijaya) + kRShNAjI pant divAn.

kAnchI followers however happily ignore evidence.
