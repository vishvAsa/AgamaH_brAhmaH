## shankara's context
No one's AchArya is above "comments", including yours and mine. Why? Because they are men, and as with pauruSheya vAkya-s, it becomes important to know the qualities and circumstances of the person producing them.


## adhyAsa on BS
shankara misrepresented bAdarAyaNa's brahmasUtra-s. This is considered separately [here](../../BS_Fraud?printCols=1&bodyFontSize=0.4cm&includeStyle=true). It's a hopeless task, and the fraud is apparent by the second sUtra itself. It's akin to dressing up a monkey like a man, and hoping no one will notice.

## Reasons?
Why did he get this itch? He could have stopped at adhyAsya-bhAShya (the introductory part), which is a perfectly respectable, if flawed, philosophical piece. Some possibilities follow.

He had attachment to vaidika-s, but was also attached to gauDapAda (who explicitly, comically, needed to clarify - "तथा ज्ञानं नैतद्बुद्धेन भाषितम्  ॥ ४.९९ ॥" in his kArika extension). So, he had to convince himself, most of all, that his vivartavAda is vaidika.

Another guess is that he was so into "अध्यास" that he just could not resist doing it on to BS and laughing at all those who fall for it.

### Commentary by force theory
parakAla yati & varadAchArya thought that it was a subversive operation against buddhists (ie. he himself did not believe in what he was writing), but that seems a very unlikely conspiracy theory. [YT](https://youtu.be/duVRhGpyoNQ?si=Je9zSWgyMEeOlsB2)  

### Asura? 
The mAdhva-s think he was some asura  
(mirroring perhaps the shAnkara belief that he was an avatAra of shiva).

The mAdhva text सुमध्व-विजय guesses that he was on the bauddha side: 

> अवैदिकं माध्यमिकं निरस्तं निरीक्ष्य तत्पक्षसुपक्षपाती ।  
तमेव पक्षं प्रतिपादुकोऽसौ न्यरूरुपन् मार्गम् इहानुरूपम्॥ १.५० ॥  

Similarly maNimanjarI - 

> सूत्रैः प्रपञ्चयाञ्चक्रे मायावी सौगतं मतम् ।  
शून्यं ब्रह्मपदेनोक्त्वा तथाविद्येति संवृतिम् ॥ ४६ ॥

### shiva's deceit?
Some quote -

> मायावादमसच्छास्त्रं प्रच्छन्नबौद्ध उच्यते।  
मयैव कथितं देवि कलौ ब्राह्मणरूपिणा।  
> (पद्मपुराण, उत्तरखण्ड, २३६/७)

and say that he was an avatAra of shiva born to delude people.

## Other commentary
Plainly, shankara was caught in a game involving buddhists and Astika-s - as in the case of such people (double agents, civilians in rebel areas), you can never be sure whose side he's on. This is apparent from his philosophy.
