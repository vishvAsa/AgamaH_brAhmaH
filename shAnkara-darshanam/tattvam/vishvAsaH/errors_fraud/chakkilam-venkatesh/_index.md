## Intro
Chakkilam Venkatesh makes several fraudulent claims on YouTube, and popular Telugu channels.  
While doing so, he was slated to teach 6 darshanas in shRngeri shAradA pITha's "Aham brahmAsmi Foundation" [TW](https://ahambrahmaasmi.org/about-us/); and called himself a "traditionally trained vedAntAchArya".  

## List of lies
Some of these have been debunked.

### Fake quotes
Fraudulent quotes from brahmasUtra-s, viShNu-purANa ([VYT](https://youtu.be/RPMtkEPuV2E)) and mahAbhArata ([VYT](https://youtu.be/98pSDGX3Bm8)).

### On vaikhAnasa darshana 
[TW](https://youtu.be/l30dALL0ykQ?t=279) 

<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

- eg. 
  - Don't believe in viShNu supremacy (वैखानसा न विष्णुपारम्यं मन्यन्ते),  
  - They have conception of "nirguNa"-brahman similar to shAnkaras.
  - They believe in jIvan-mukti.
  - Don't have chatur-vyUha-like concept (ते च चतुर्व्यूहरूपं भगवतो न मन्यन्ते)
  - Implicitly - non-vishiShTAdvaitism (न च तेषां विशिष्टाद्वैतं दर्शनम्)
- Contradicted by
  - Agama-vimarsha by Prof viShNu bhaTTAchAryulu of tirupati CSU, Agama advisor to TTD temple ([TW](https://nsktu.ac.in/storage/2021/07/Resume.pdf))
  - brahma-sUtra-bhAShya of shrInivAsa-makhI, with subcommentary by sundararAja
    - Their utpatty-asambhavAdhikaraNa defends pAncharAtra.
  - tAtparya-chandrikA with दश-विध-हेतु-निरूपणम् of shrInivAsa-makhI.
  - vaikhAnasa-matra-prashna's pAramAtmikopaniShad-bhAShya by shrInivAsa-yajvA.
  - vaikhAnasa-dharma-sUtram, nRsiMha-vAjapeyi's commentary ("निर्गुण")
</details>


### On rAmAnuja and vishiShTAdvaita

- [TW](https://youtu.be/l30dALL0ykQ?t=226)

- Claims rAmAnuja ascribes arguments rejecting 
- Claims vishiShTAdvaita is based on pAncharAtra (and contrasts with vaikhAnasa-s)
  - How then do vaikhAnasa-s, who don't follow pAncharAtra, claim to be shrI-vishiShTAdvaitins?
  - Nowhere does rAmANuja use pAncharAtra quotes to support vishiShTAdvaita.

### Reactions
#### Chakkilam venkatesh
- Falsely claimed to have "paraphrased" brahma-sUtra-s in various videos ( [VYT](https://youtu.be/hjdiTt9ikaI)), without any reference to viShNu-purANa and mahAbhArata fabrications.
- He "invited" people for video debate on Twitter and on videos, then backed away when the challenge was accepted (by blocking challengers on social media, deleting their comments). He claimed that the opponents were "not qualified" to debate him etc.. ( [VYT](https://youtu.be/hjdiTt9ikaI))
- Hypocritically published a legal threat against those pointing out his fraudulent claims, while slandering various vaiShNava sampradAyas and AchAryas, and publishing a legal disclaimer on one such video.
- Deleted comments challenging his views. [TW](https://x.com/dyugangaa/status/1986675782585094296). Blocked challengers on Instagram and Twitter.
- Took down videos countering his videos based on copyright claims, making his original video private : [TW](https://x.com/agnimaan/status/1990252007731634306)
- Continued to mispresent vaikhAnasa-s and rAmAnuja (listed above).

#### Other shANkarans
- shANkarans on advaita-l mail-stream 
  - reluctantly admitted _some_ of his fabrications (brahma-sUtra-s), while defending the overall video. [TW](https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2025-November/064334.html)
- Aham Brahmasmi, only after being publicly prodded on advaita-l mail-stream (and not before, when it's trustee was informed), disavowed connection to any independent statements (with no reference to chakkilam venkatesh) [TW](https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2025-November/064332.html), but did not take any further publicly visible action.
