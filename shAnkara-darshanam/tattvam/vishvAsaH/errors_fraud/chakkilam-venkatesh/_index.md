## Intro
Chakkilam Venkatesh makes several fraudulent claims on YouTube, and popular Telugu channels.  
While doing so, he was slated to teach 6 darshanas in shRngeri shAradA pITha's "Aham brahmAsmi Foundation" [TW](https://ahambrahmaasmi.org/about-us/); and called himself a "traditionally trained vedAntAchArya".  

## List of lies
Some of these have been debunked.

- Fraudulent quotes from brahmasUtra-s, viShNu-purANa ([YT](https://youtu.be/RPMtkEPuV2E)) and mahAbhArata (YT](https://youtu.be/98pSDGX3Bm8)).
- Lies about vaikhAnasa darshana : [TW](https://youtu.be/l30dALL0ykQ?t=279)  
- Lies about rAmAnuja's commentary : [TW](https://youtu.be/l30dALL0ykQ?t=226)


### Reactions
- Chakkilam venkatesh -
  - Falsely claimed to have "paraphrased" brahma-sUtra-s in various videos ( [VYT](https://youtu.be/hjdiTt9ikaI)), without any reference to viShNu-purANa and mahAbhArata fabrications.
    - He "invited" people for video debate on Twitter and on videos, then backed away when the challenge was accepted (by blocking challengers on social media, deleting their comments). He claimed that the opponents were "not qualified" to debate him etc..
  - hypocritically made a legal threat against those pointing out his fraudulent claims.
  - Continued to mispresent vaikhAnasa-s and rAmAnuja (listed above).
- shANkarans on advaita-l mail-stream 
  - reluctantly admitted _some_ of his fabrications (brahma-sUtra-s), while defending the overall video.
- Aham Brahmasmi, only after being publicly prodded on advaita-l mail-stream (and not before, when it's trustee was informed), disavowed connection to any independent statements (with no reference to chakkilam venkatesh), but did not take any further publicly visible action.
