00:00 - Intro
02:30 - **न** त्व् एवाहं जातु **नासं**  न त्वं, नेमे जनाधिपाः।  **न** चैव, **न भविष्यामः**   सर्वे वयम् अतः परम्॥2.12॥
04:14 - Brief commentary
04:30 - bhagavAn says that there are multiple Atmans.

19:55 - 2 moon illusion - Person with bad eyes doesn't go saying "there are 2 moons".
22:00 - Do shAnkaran gurus really have tattva-jnAna? Then why upadesha?
24:00 - Teaching others is useless post-jnAna as per shAnkaran thought.
25:00 - Forced to be a polar-opposite of Abrahamism?
28:00 - **अविभक्तं** च भूतेषु  **विभक्तम् इव** च स्थितम्।  भूत-भर्तृ च तज् ज्ञेयं  ग्रसिष्णु प्रभविष्णु च॥13.17॥

08:44 - viShNu-supremacy in vaikhAnasa darshana (refers to Agama-vimarsha by viShNu-bhaTTa, dasha-vidha-hetu-nirUpaNa by shrInivAsa makhI)
12:04 - Meaning of "nirguNa" in vaikhAnasa doctrine differs from shAnkara imagination (uttama-brahma-vidyA-sAra of sundararAja, vaikhAnasa-vijaya, shrInivAsa-yajvan's bhAShya on pAramAtmikopaniShat, nRsiMha-vAjapeyi on vaikhAnasa dharmasUtra, shrInivAsa makhI's gRhya-sUtra commentary)
24:35 - chAtur-vyUha concept in dasha-vidha-hetu-nirUpaNa by shrInivAsa makhI
28:00 - jIvan-mukti not moxa as per vaikhAnasa-s. Endorsement of vaikuNTha and 3 other loka-s. (refers to Agama-vimarsha by viShNu-bhaTTa, brahma-sUtra-shrI-vishiShTAdvaita-bhAShya by shrInivAsa-makhI)
31:30 - vishiShTAdvaita is the philosophy of vaikhAnasa-s.
33:55 - Chakkilam venkaTesh's lies about rAmAnuja, vishiShTAdvaita, pAncharAtra.
35:55 - vaikhAnasa-brahma-sUtra-bhAShya's utpatty-asambhavAdhikaraNa defends pAncharAtra and 4-vyUha conception.
39:15 - vaikhAnasa's greatness beyond pAncharAtra
40:15 - Conclusion, and a question - Is Chakkilam Venkatesh, who lies and fakes so much, qualified to call himself vedAntAchArya and teach 6-darshanas?

00:00 - Intro
01:00 - shrI Vikram jagannAthan refutes *SB – maya = NB* and *NB + maya = SB*
03:54 - shrI Vikram jagannAthan says *NB + maya = SB* is not ok, but *SB = maya + NB*  is OK.
05:55 - shrI rAghav dwivedula (supposedly agreeing with vikram) says *SB – maya = NB* is OK, but  *NB + maya = SB* is not OK.

## neo-shankara confusion - "parameshvara" refers directly to nirguNa-brahman? mysticism vs logic

<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

Challenge video - https://youtu.be/bJl8wumOIFw

00:00 - Intro, significance
01:30 - Word vs sentence vs passage meanings.
03:55 - avAchyatA and meaninglessness of nirguNa-brahman is not relevant.
06:55 - parameshvara etymology
08:55 - ShrI v subramanian's blunder "स्यात्परमेश्वरस्यापीच्छावशान् मायामयं रूपं साधकानुग्रहार्थम् ... Here, in that bhashya, Parameshwara is NB."
09:30 - "निरस्तसर्वविशेषं पारमेश्वरं" (proposed by shrI venkaT shiva); shrI Vikram falsely claims absence of syntactical meaning
11:45 - "आत्मेत्येव परमेश्वरः प्रतिपत्तव्यः ।" (proposed by shrI ravishankar) vs अद्वैतेश्वरस्य अपहत-पाप्मत्वादि-गुणता
15:10 - ईशिता परमेश्वरः परमात्मा सर्वस्य । स हि सर्वमीष्टे सर्वजन्तूनामात्मा ... (proposed by shrI ravishankar)
16:05 - BSB-1.3.42 - योऽयं विज्ञानमयः प्राणेषु संसारी लक्ष्यते, स वा एष महान् अज आत्मा परमेश्वर एवास्माभिः प्रतिपादित इत्यर्थः (proposed by shrI vikram jagannAthan) vs "प्राज्ञः परमेश्वरः, सर्वज्ञत्वलक्षणया प्रज्ञया नित्यमवियोगात्। "
19:10 - Appeal to tapas, yoga, transcendence just to understand and explain shows intellectual unsoundness.

## shankara bhAShya challenge - show parameshvara refers to nirguNa brahman without going via saguNa .

<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

**Challenge statement** - Show any sentence from shAnkara bhAShya where "parameshvara", by itself, unambiguously refers directly to nirguNa brahman (SB) without going via saguNa brahman (NB).  ("निरस्तसर्वविशेषं पारमेश्वरं" obviously doesn't cut it - it explicitly deletes visheSha from parameshvara.)

shrI Vikram Jagannathan's mail - https://lists.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2025-November/064339.html


00:00 - Intro
01:20 - shrI V subrahmanian's error - claims "स्यात्परमेश्वरस्यापीच्छावशान् मायामयं रूपं साधकानुग्रहार्थम् ... Here, in that bhashya, Parameshwara is NB."
04:30 - V subrahmanian says mAya + NB is SB
07:20 - venkaT shiva says "स्यात्परमेश्वरस्यापीच्छावशान् मायामयं रूपं साधकानुग्रहार्थम् ... The above is saguNa brahma."
08:55 - V subrahmanian hides venkat siva's disagreement, and claims only agreement.
13:00 - "parameshvara Ultimately pointing" to NB (via SB)" vs the word parameshvara pointing to nirguNa brahma directly and not saguNa. **Challenge statement**
15:30 - Admission of intellectual unsoundness of (neo-)shAnkara advaita
16:25 - Misquoting proof based on "yena" and "idam" usage  (Original video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXpUd-mYzNs&t=90s )
19:00 - Conclusion, repetition of challenge.

09:30 - gaNAnAm tvA gaNapatim refers to brahmaNas-pati as per sAyaNa. 
11:05 - cause for twisted thought

<details><summary>विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)</summary>

I emphasize that my video has been misidentified as infringing, and am willing to possibly defend the action brought against me by the copyright holder. So I resubmit my counter notification.

My video contains short clips and screenshots from Chakkilam Venkatesh's original video (https://youtu.be/UwavQTKrOTs?t=1327) pointing out the false quotations from well known Hindu texts, with original comments and further reference to authoritative texts. As such, this is covered under "fair use" or "fair dealing" under Section 52 of the Copyright Act, 1957 (Using excerpts for criticism or review purposes). 

Chakkilam Venkatesh's misuse of copyright law to silence critics who point out his lies should be punished. My video should be reinstated.
