One is free to present one's views, but it would be good to do so without misrepresenting the views of other people.

## Pey-ALHvAr
[vinay vAraNAsI](https://youtu.be/zcr2pQOtRDI?t=552) - tirupati image does not have an axe; rather venkaTeshvara manifested himself in that form for the ALHvAr, and he described it as such -  ([TW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPaJKAuB8Q0)) . Just as venkaTeshvara manifesting in the form of a fish, or tortoise doesn't mean he is identical with those animals; the same applies to this manifestation. Separation of deities may be verified from the ALvAr's other works. 


## jnAnasambandha
vinay: [TW](https://youtu.be/zcr2pQOtRDI?t=3361)

- jnAnasambandha was a shaiva, who distinguished him from viShNu; as may be verified from his works. Not a hari-harAbheda-vAdI. 

## annamAchArya
vinay: [TW](https://youtu.be/zcr2pQOtRDI?t=646)

- annamAchArya is said to be a devout shrI-vaiShNava, but his words are twisted, and he too is presented as a hari-harAbheda-vAdI.

The pallavi notably (following BG) provides context -

> enta mAtramuna evvaru talachina anta mAtramE neevu  
antarAntamu lenchi chooDa pinDantE nippaTi yannaTlu ||

>  Oh Venkatapati,your presence and grace depend upon how well a person thinks about you. When I observe sincerely, it is just like the size and quality of a pan-cake depending on the batter. 

AnnamachArya was an initiated shrIvaiShNava; so naturally, the implication is that shaivas etc.. get lesser grace based on their lesser understanding. ("अन्तवत्तु फलं तेषां तद्भ‍वत्यल्पमेधसाम् ।")
