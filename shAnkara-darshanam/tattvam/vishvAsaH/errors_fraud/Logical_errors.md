## avdiyA anirvachanIyA
- If brahman is the only real, what is avidyA, which apparently is a co-eternal? 
  - jivas having no beginning, as admitted by shankara, implies that avidyA too is beginningless. The only way out would be to say that avidyA (and jIva-s) can have an end; but we don't know if it will.
