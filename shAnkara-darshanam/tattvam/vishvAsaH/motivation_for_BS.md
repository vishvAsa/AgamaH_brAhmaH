## shankara's context
No one's AchArya is above "comments", including yours and mine. Why? Because they are men, and as with pauruSheya vAkya-s, it becomes important to know the qualities and circumstances of the person producing them.

Plainly, shankara was caught in a game involving buddhists and Astika-s - as in the case of such people (double agents, civilians in rebel areas), you can never be sure whose side he's on. This is apparent from his philosophy.

## adhyAsa on BS
नमो मायाविने तस्माय्  
अध्यास-व्यसनात् स यः।  
चिक्षेप ब्रह्म-सूत्रेषु  
विवर्तं भाष्य-भाषितम्॥

It is clear from his own admission, that he was interested in foisting nirguNa-brahma-vivarta-vAda on to brahma-sUtra-s, rather than explaining it as it is. (Contrast अध्यासवादं प्रसाध्य - "यथा चायमर्थो वेदान्तानां तथा वयमस्यां शारीरकमीमांसायां प्रदर्शयिष्यामः" with R's "तन्मतानुसारेण सूत्राक्षराणि व्याख्यास्यन्ते"). It's a hopeless task, and the fraud is apparent by the second sUtra itself. It's akin to dressing up a monkey like a man, and hoping no one will notice.

Besides rAmAnuja and the mAdhvas, it was noticed by bhAskara as well - 

> सूत्राभिप्राय-संवृत्या  
> स्वाभिप्राय-प्रकाशनात् ।  
> **व्याख्यातं** यैर् इदं शास्त्रं  
> **व्याख्येयं** तन्-निवृत्तये ॥

## Reasons?
Why did he get this itch? He could have stopped at adhyAsya-bhAShya (the introductory part), which is a perfectly respectable, if flawed, philosophical piece. Some possibilities follow.

He had attachment to vaidika-s, but was also attached to gauDapAda (who explicitly, comically, needed to clarify - "तथा ज्ञानं नैतद्बुद्धेन भाषितम्  ॥ ४.९९ ॥" in his kArika extension). So, he had to convince himself, most of all, that his vivartavAda is vaidika.

Another guess is that he was so into "अध्यास" that he just could not resist doing it on to BS and laughing at all those who fall for it.

parakAla yati & varadAchArya thought that it was a subversive operation against buddhists (ie. he himself did not believe in what he was writing), but that seems a very unlikely conspiracy theory. [YT](https://youtu.be/duVRhGpyoNQ?si=Je9zSWgyMEeOlsB2)  


The mAdhva text सुमध्व-विजय guesses that he was on the bauddha side: 

> अवैदिकं माध्यमिकं निरस्तं निरीक्ष्य तत्पक्षसुपक्षपाती ।  
तमेव पक्षं प्रतिपादुकोऽसौ न्यरूरुपन्मार्गमिहानुरूपम्॥ १.५० ॥  

Similarly maNimanjarI - 

> सूत्रैः प्रपञ्चयाञ्चक्रे मायावी सौगतं मतम् ।  
शून्यं ब्रह्मपदेनोक्त्वा तथाविद्येति संवृतिम् ॥ ४६ ॥
