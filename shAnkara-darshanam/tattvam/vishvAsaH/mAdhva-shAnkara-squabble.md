title = "mAdhva-shAnkara squabble"
+++

mAdhva-mata can be termed a counter counter-religion (shAnkara's bauddha base being considered).

## Text torture
Btw, mAdhva-s are reputed for torturing texts (which is fair); but shAnkara torture (also very apparent to anyone who knows basics of language and has common sense) is relatively unknown. The former seems to be a (bad) response to the latter - 

> "You think you can torture texts? Haha you know nothing - I will show you what real torture is". 

A superior response would have been to show how you can make sense of contradictory statements without torture (as done in the rAmAnuja school).

## Interpolations
Both shAnkara-s and mAdhva-s are accused of interpolation. shAnkara misattribution of hundreds of texts to shankara is also well known. Some examples elsewhere.

## Divinity of shankara
Perhaps in reaction to shAnkara deification of shankara as an avatAra of shiva, mAdhva-s make him an avatAra of the asura maNimAn(??). They also consider madhva to be vAyu.

## Mistreatment
Nominal shAnkara-s visit and feast in mAdhva-maTha-s without problems, while mAdhva teachings prohibit them from accepting water and food from smArta-s. 

Also to be noted - learned mAdhva-s don't consider most smArta-s real shAnkara-s (despite nominal confusion) since they don't even study and understand shankara correctly.
