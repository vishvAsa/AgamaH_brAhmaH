> if you dont have respect for an aachaarya like bhagavadpada, bloody stay away from him.... you have no freaking business to be derogatory...   
> call our aachaaryaa as shankaraacharrya first... we call him that way and if you refer to him, you are suppose to call him that way... you have no right to call him sankaran etc

There is no disrespect intended in plain "shankara" or "rAmAnuja" - you're psychotic if you think otherwise, like muslims who insist on appending PBUH in front of mohammed.

(yajurveda_hari blinded by rage - )

> One of them said, putting "Adi" before Shankara is like PBUH it seems...Thoooo...

> i will get your channel shut down if you continue this personal attack...  

I was not derogatory to your AchArya-s, neither am I making any personal attacks on them. I only encourage them to fully adhere to shankara's standards of truth. As such I am not scared of your baseless accusations and threats (typical of a shAnkara, unfortunately).

### दमोपदेशः
> let us follow our vedanta and you follow yours peacefully  .. you are just fuelling more divide.

> If you have knowledge go do discussion with scholars.

As to doctrinal issues, I have discussed with your "scholars" and found them to be pathetic frauds -  https://youtu.be/joyvSgQvvb8 https://youtu.be/bJl8wumOIFw https://youtu.be/IbhlFO92ZMA https://youtu.be/0pyIqn9M0zk



#### सत्येऽनादरः
> TRUTH should be searched inside if you really want not condemning others just for number of views.

There is such a thing as objective truth. Eg. you can go and see for yourself if there is a "dhanAkarShaNa yantra" or a mAdhva inscription. shankara agreed with this.

> I tried to reason with Adi Shankara's followers in the group that this particular interpretation by Acharya Shankara is incorrect, as can be noticed by any student of Sanskrit. ... However, no one saw the merit in this argument of mine. That's what blind following does to people. They can't notice what's right in front of them.
