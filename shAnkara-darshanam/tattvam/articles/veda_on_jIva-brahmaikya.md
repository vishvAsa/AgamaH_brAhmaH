(Described elsewhere - veda is the only pramANa for brahman being prior to the opertion of pratyaxa and anumAna; anubhava being brahman itself.)

From mAdhavIya digvijaya

> Here, the two birds are the Jiva and Brahman, and the Sruti asserts their difference. By this the Sruti contradicts the idea of their unity which, you say, is asserted by other Vedic sentences.
>
> SANKARA: There are many Srutis condemning the perception of diversity as: 'He who sees only diversity here, goes from death to death' etc. 
> 
> As against these, quoting a sentence pertaining to facts known even otherwise, through perception etc., will not weaken the Sruti passages that declare the unity of existence. They only describe the apparent nature, the wrong notions, of   [[100]] things, as seen in ignorance, say, like the silver in nacre. A Vedic sentence must give you some knowledge unattainable through other means like perception, or they must prompt you to some fruitful action.
