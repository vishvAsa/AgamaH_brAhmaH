  <p>(KNOWLEDGE OF FIVE SHEATHS OF EXISTANCE)</p>
<p>Another equally important prakriya about understanding the ‘self’ isbeautifully explained in Taittirīya Upaniṣad and it is quite interesting. We will now deliberate on this prakriya as it is called as Pañca-kośa-viveka which is contained in the Bhṛguvalli (2) of the said Upaniṣad.</p>
<p><strong>भृगुर्वै वारुणिः वरुणं पितरं उपससार अधीहि भगवो ब्रह्मेति ॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bhr̥gurvai vāruṇiḥ varuṇaṁ pitaraṁ upasasāra adhīhi bhagavō brahmēti.</strong></p>
<p>There is seeker called Bhṛgu. He goes to his teacher who is also his father by name Varuṇa.What question he goes with? Master, give me the wisdom of the self; tell me about the self or the causal stuff of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>तस्मा एतत्प्रोवाच अन्नम् प्राणं चक्षुः श्रोत्रं मनो वाचमिति॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tasmā ētat-prōvāca annam prāṇaṁ cakṣuḥ śrōtraṁ manō vācam-iti.</strong></p>
<p>The Teacher Varuṇa told his disciple that Food, i.e., the body (Śarīra), Vital Force which operates inside the body, the tools of cognising, i.e., eyes, ears, mind, etc., are the doors to realize brahman.</p>
<p><strong>यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। येन जातानि जीवन्त। यत्प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्ति। तद्विजिज्ञासस्व। तद्ब्रह्मेति॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yatō vā imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, yēna jātāni jīvanti, yat-prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti, tat- vijijñāsasva, tat-brahma-iti.</strong></p>
<p>The Teacher gives the most scientific definition of Brahman or the ultimate reality or the Causal stuff of the Universe as -whatever is the causal stuff from whichthis world is born, whatever sustains this universeand in whatever stuff into which the world dissolves,that is Brahma.</p>
<p>This is an excellent definition according to cosmology or even according to theoretical physics. Then the teacher asks the student to sit and do tapas (meditate)-that means the teacher doesn’t give the ultimate truth because the student does not gain by simply listening to the truth. Investigation by the person alone would open the door to the answer. Truth had to be discovered, only then it would become valuable.Then the student after deliberation within himself comes to the following conclusion-</p>
<p><strong>अन्नं ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात्। अन्नाद्ध्येव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। अन्नेन जातानि जीवन्ति। अन्नं यत्प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्तीति॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Annaṁ brahma-iti vyajānāt, annāt-hi-ēva khalu- imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, annēna jātāni jīvanti, annaṁ yat-prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti-iti.</strong></p>
<p>The student understood that this body is &ldquo;I&rdquo; and is called as anna. Anna (the food) is brahma, because all living things originate from anna-lives because of anna and return to the same anna. The teacher neither accepts his word nor suggests any answer but sends him back to investigate again. “By intense thinking seek Brahman”.</p>
<p><strong>तपसा ब्रह्म विजिज्ञासस्व। तपो ब्रह्मेति।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tapasā brahma vijijñāsasva, tapō brahma-iti.</strong></p>
<p>It is at this point we should also make a study as to why the R̥ṣi sent back his student to study further. If I were this body, then after death no one should feel sorry for me because this body is very much present here. Śankara, in his Bhajagovindaṁsays that even the wife of that person who is dead, is afraid of that body-gatavati_ <em>vayou</em> <em>prāṇāpāye</em> <em>bhāryā</em> <em>bibhyati</em> <em>tasmin</em> _kāye <em>–<strong>गतवति वायौ प्राणापाये भार्या बिभ्यति तस्मिन् काये।</strong></em> that means even the woman who was so intimate when the person was alive feels that the body should be disposed off as quickly as possible. Why? The wife did not see the husband in the body. She saw the husband only in the living body when the body had life.  Why? The body is not me, by common sense. The life that goes with the body is the precious thing. The body becomes lifeless on death. Then after further thought, the student returns and says**–**</p>
<p><strong>प्राणो ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात्। प्राणाद्ध्येव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। प्राणेन जातानि जीवन्ति। प्राणं प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्तीति॥            -</strong> (Bhṛguvalli 3)</p>
<p><strong>Prāṇō brahma-iti vyajānāt, prāṇāt-hi-ēva khalu-imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, prāṇēna jātāni jīvanti prāṇaṁ  prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti-iti.</strong></p>
<p>He comes to the conclusion that prāṇa, the vital force is that “I”.   It is from prāṇa that all these living beings are born. Being produced from it, they live by it and in the end become one with it. The spandana, the vibration, the movement inside, which makes transactions possible for the body is that “I”. The teacher directs the disciple to do further investigation to arrive at the Truth. <strong>Tapasā brahma vijijñāsasva</strong></p>
<p>The disciple is asked to ponder as to what is wrong with prāṇa?    Why that “I” really is not that Prāṇa. If one has just the body and prāṇa, we all very well know that it is useless to him and to others. This is the case with the person who is in the state of coma who will be just like bellows working to and fro - vegetating stuff as the doctors put it. So prāṇa is not that “I”. There is something more. Cognition, grasping things, usefully using them and working with them is something worthwhile.  Otherwise who wants that just respirating body! The student after further struggle returns with the report that-</p>
<p><strong>मनो ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mano Brahma-iti Vyajānāt.</strong>  -  (Bhṛguvalli 4)</p>
<p>He concludes that MIND is that “I”. Mind through indriyā-s can capture things, can use it for one’s own joy or whatever it is. Indriya Vyāpāra dictated by Mind (Manas) is that real “I”. So this me is the mind- not the mere Prāṇa.  But the teacher dismisses him once again and orders him to do tapas and find the real truth.</p>
<p>Why is the mind not &ldquo;me&rdquo; has to be questioned here.-what is the shortcoming about mind being identified with “I”?  The simple explanation could be, mind can only take perceptions- that’s all- it cannot discriminate. It cannot see what is good for the living thing and what is bad for that, what is useful and what is not useful, what is injurious and what is not injurious. That’s the stage of the child.  Till three/four years, a child does not know how to find out what is good or bad, due to which it can cause injury to itself.  Mind is there, perception of objects is there, but judgment is not there. So self destruction could be possible. If you had only Manokośa and no Vijñānakośa, then discrimination is not possible. If both potassium cyanide and sugar are given together, one can consume former for latter and may end his life due to lack of understanding. So, Manokośa is incomplete because there is no discrimination, the faculty to know what is good or what is bad, what is useful or what is not, etc. Later, the student after further investigation asserts that-</p>
<p><strong>विज्ञानं ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात् ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vijñānaṁ Brahma-iti Vyajānāt.</strong>  - (Bhṛguvalli 5)</p>
<p>Intellect is - that “I”. The teacher dismisses this point also. All of us know that Vijñānakośa is the one of discrimination, and judgment.  Why did the teacher dismiss it?  This stand of the teacher is an unacceptable position to all of us, since we assume that Vijñānakośa is the ultimate. That is the cream of man, that is the best of man and it is through this kośa humans do things, earn food, clothing and shelter. The primitive man could not have lived without that, as protection from predators was not possible without Vijñānakośa. So, Vijñānakośa is the best of me.</p>
<p>If one looks at the old temples and the present day structures, where columns and beams are used, it will immediately occur to everyone about the wonders of Vijñānakośa.  In olden days, they could not think of a beam more than five or six feet and they had to have hundreds of them in a huge structure. Now it is possible to build a large span of 60ft or 80ft without a pillar in between with the knowledge of this kośa. Today, surgery has become so easy with very high advancement in the anaesthesia technology. All this has been possible because of this kośa. So, Vijñānakośa is the best of man for his welfare and for thewelfare of the community. So, it looks that the study of the ātman is complete with “I” being equated to Vijñānakośa.   Most of the systems of philosophy stopped here. Tobe moral, to be ethical, sharing what we have with the have-nots is the outcome of this understanding. Despite these benefits, why the teacher did not accept this kośa as the ultimate is the point to ponder over.</p>
<p>Now, we have to discuss as to what are the shortcomings of this kośa.  If we can appreciate where the Vijñānakośa is defective then we have appreciated Vedānta. Do we have a pre Vijñānakośa state of existence? Granting that we have a pre Vijñānakośa state, is it worthwhile? Do we have enough pramāṇa or evidence to prove that?  If we can answer successfully these questions then we have appreciated the theme of Vedānta.   Between manokośa and Vijñānakośa, the difference is that manokośa involves random thinking. It doesn’t arrange things whereas Vijñānakośa has sequential thinking, therefore very productive, very performing. In the cause&ndash;result way we think and get results.</p>
<p>Let us take an example. Take the case of a lady who is managing the house hold affairs and taking care of children and other needs of the house. If you watch carefully, she has so many needs to be attended to simultaneously, like attending to the child’s needs before putting him/her to the school bus, attending to the husband’s needs before sending him off to office, preparing food at the same time. So many things are disorderly and all these have to be attended to in a hard pressed time frame.  All these call for full performance of the vijñāna- kośa. After all these activities, she throws herself on the couch nearby, with a deep sigh of relief from what she has done with the problems. By dropping herself, her Vijñānakośa is also dropped. She wants to go to a state of no work, which is comforting for her and she wants to remain in this state for some time at least before she starts working again. This is an indication that there is a subtler and valuable phase of existence with no more problems bothering her.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you watch a researcher, he also shakes off after a serious work and sits quietly sipping a cup of coffee or whatever. It turns out to be a fact that Vijñānakośa, however grand it appears, is incomplete and is taxing. Any vyāpāra is taxing whether you like it or not. After hard work, every one of us feels relieved and that is the point where Vedānta alone shows the secret of happiness. The lady in our example is willing to throw away the Vijñānakośa as it is taxing and go to a pre Vijñānakośa state which is more comforting. This is the new wisdom that Vedānta gives to man, a missing element for the present day civilization.</p>
<p>Performance is all right. If possible, let us all do it leisurely without target, not giving full pressure to our system.  Unfortunately, we are all put to very strict goals and we take that as the aim of life. We do not seem to think that we can perform better if we do things at a lesser pace. We are always worried that someone else would excel our performance. To come out of this, we have to take a dip in the state of no work which is amṛtasthāna, whereas performance is āyāsasthāna. Resting rejuvenates man, like taking a tonic. If one had stayed on in Vijñānakośa continuously he would have broken down. Fortunately, <u>we are oscillating between rest and performance</u> without knowing the dangers of this Vijñānakośa. This knowledge about things has to be corrected in the light of our experience. Although we have been unknowingly experiencing moments of relaxation, we have not recognised thesame. Taittirīya Upaniṣat (Brahmānandavalli 2-7-3) puts this very beautifully-</p>
<p><strong>कोह्येवान्यात् कः प्राण्यात्। यदेष आकाश आनन्दो न स्यात॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kō-hi-ēva-anyāt kaḥ prāṇyāt, yadēṣa ākāśa ānandō na syāt.</strong></p>
<p>Who would have done respiration if there was no ānanda in ākāśa dharma or a no mind state?</p>
<p>We touch our ākāśa dharma by <u>letting go the confinement.</u> If we did not touch this emptiness or the quietness in us, how couldwe have lived, how could we have respired? Our inhalation and exhalation would have been impossible and we wouldhave broken down - <strong>yeśa hi eva ānandayati - एषह्येवानन्दयति.</strong> This ākāśa dharma is only the source of joy or ānanda. So the student discovers the last truth-</p>
<p><strong>आनन्दो ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात्। आनन्दाद्ध्येव खल्विमानि भूतानि जायन्ते। आनन्देन जातानि जीवन्ति। आनन्दं प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्तीति।</strong>(Bhṛguvalli 6)</p>
<p><strong>Ānandō brahma-iti vyajānāt, ānandāt- hi-ēva khalu-imāni bhūtāni jāyantē, ānandēna jātāni jīvanti, ānandaṁ prayanti-abhisaṁviśanti-iti.</strong></p>
<p>From ānanda you are born, your activity is sustained.  It is because of the ānanda that you experience here,you get back to your ānanda- sthāna when you die. It is the SOURCE, which is the sustaining stuff, the‘ONE’ into which activity dissolves. When the student discovered that, he had nothing else to verify because he was so certain that he did not approach the teacher to verify whether he was correct or not. So, the Upaniṣad ends with the mantra—</p>
<p><strong>सैषा भार्गवी वारुणी विद्या। परमे व्योमन् प्रतिष्ठित।।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sā-ēṣā bhārgavī vāruṇī vidyā, paramē vyōman pratiṣṭhita.</strong>(Bhṛguvalli 6)</p>
<p>This is the great wisdom given by Varuṇa, the father and the teacher, to the student Bhṛgu. What did this knowledge do to the student?  Itput him in to that limitless emptiness or the expansiveness that we are all structured with. Upaniṣad further boldly puts it-Upaniṣad affirms that all persons irrespective of cast, creed, religion or place are eligible to attain this ānanda and one who knows about this comforting silence, enjoys the amanībhāva- permanent happiness.</p>
<p><strong>प्रतितिष्ठति अद्वये आनन्द मात्रे आत्मनि प्रतितिष्ठति।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prati-tiṣṭhati advayē ānanda mātrē ātmani prati-tiṣṭhati.</strong></p>
<p>He gets established in that stateas it is his true self and every one of us could touch that state because it isour very natureand stay there as long as one wants.</p>
<p>There is one more point there. When you touch that mahāvishrānti, that expansion, it is not the helpless expansion or helpless silence of the idiot.  It is thatexpansionwhich is the abode of all the activities. It is the base of creativity. You are not powerless there. You can do any amount of performance, you can apply kumbhana that can shake the world and can lift mountains. Power and silence can coexist. It is further declared in Bhṛguvalli 7 that:</p>
<p><strong>अन्नवान् अन्नादो भवति। महान् भवति प्रजया पशुभिः ब्रह्मवर्चसेन महान् कीर्त्या।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Annavān annādō bhavati, mahān bhavati prajayā paśubhiḥ brahma-varcasēna mahān kīrtyā.</strong></p>
<p>You get all mundane gains. You get all creative energies. If you touch that state, you get plenty of material wealth. How can non-doing beget all these? That’s the cosmic law. If you position yourself there, by a mere sankalpa, you can achieve whatever you want.</p>
<p>Annavān bhavati, annādo bhavati - <strong>अन्नवान् भवति</strong>। <strong>‍अन्नादो भवति</strong>। - Indriya patutwa increases. Annādameans digestive power.</p>
<p>Mahān bhavati prajayā- paśubhiḥ - <strong>महान् भवति प्रजया‍ पशुभि:</strong>। People applaud you, people praise you, and look at you with great respect. All mundane gains automatically come to a man who is a brahmajñāni- who is brhmaniṣṭa- It is very difficult to grasp the mechanism involved. Possible explanation is that when there is cittaśuddhi of that order, it may be possible to materialise things of your choice. Here we may get a doubt as to whether the Śāstra is ridiculing lower levels. Śāstra is not ridiculing the lower levels at all.</p>
<p>Prāṇamayakośa**- प्राणमयकोश** -is much superior to annamayakośa- because the burden of mass is gone. You have lifted yourself. At the prāṇamayakośa level, mass is gone. If you observe a rocket, every few seconds some mass is reduced as it soars higher. Anger is a linear property as it is in prāṇamayakośa. It is confined.</p>
<p>But when you come to manomayakośa, you are in three dimensions- you are everywhere. Manomayakośa has brought in the element of expansiveness losing the defect called linearity. This kośa is superior to prāṇamayakośa when you identify with each kośa. But, what is wrong with manomāyakośa and how is vijñānamayakośa superior? Upaniṣad beautifully puts it thus-</p>
<p><strong>तस्य ऋतम् दक्षिणः पक्षः‍। सत्यम् उत्तरः पक्षः। योग आत्मा।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tasya ṛtam dakṣiṇaḥ pakṣaḥ, satyam uttaraḥ pakṣaḥ, yoga ātmā</strong>.</p>
<p>I was bothered about the word Yoga, as how its use has come in here, in the context of vijñānakośa? I could gather that yoga in this context means samādhāna. That is the point of difference between manas and vijñānakośa. So, if you sit in an endless space, you can at once see thousands miles. This means that you are just all that space. It is not that you moved from here to there. Your sarvavyāpitva has set in. One component of Brahmalakṣaṇa is already achieved. But then what is wrong? How is it still different from Brahma? Though vistārata has been achieved, cancalatva of the mind has not gone. It is due to Vistārata, that Vijñānakośa is extraordinary- that is why creativity has come in. It is very superior since naidhānya has set in. That is why achievement is possible both in science and technology and in understanding self.</p>
<p>When you compare vijñānakośa and ānadakośa, expansion is common, cognition also is common.  There is a bit of focusing in former without which performance is not possible. Ānadamayakośa has no dwaita bodha. Creation is assembling of things in an order. In ānanda- simply pictures and sounds are there, but no assembly takes place as in vijñānakośa.</p>
<p>Vistārata is there in manokośa, but naidhānya is not there. That has come in vijñānakośa and that ānanda has already come to you because of relaxation. But, dwaita-bodha is destroyed only in ānandakośa since focusing is not there.</p>
<p><strong>तस्य प्रियमेव शिर</strong>:<strong>। मोदो दक्शिण</strong>:<strong>पक्श</strong>:<strong>। प्रमोदो उत्तर</strong>: <strong>पक्श</strong>:<strong>। आनन्द आत्मा</strong>।.</p>
<p><strong>Tasya priyamēva śiraḥ- modo dakṣiṇaḥ pakṣaḥ pramodo uttaraḥ pakṣaḥ- ānanda ātmā.</strong></p>
<p>The characteristic of Ānandakośa is that it is near to Samādhi state. One can ask the difference between ānandakośa and vijñānakośa-Śankara clarifies that in Vijñānakośa, individualisation or localisation has not gone. That is, object has a locus –KHANDATVA in this Kośa. But, in Ānandakośa this defect is not there.</p>
<p>Now, the question arises as to whether Ānandakośa itself is the ultimate position? Śankara puts forth his argument thus:</p>
<p>Ānanda is included in Pancakośa. Thus, a kośa wnich represents confinement cannot be a property of Brahma. Hence Ānandakośa cannot represent Brahma, since confinement is still there in that Kośa.</p>
<p>Secondly, <strong>brahmapuccham pratiṣṭha - ब्रह्मपुच्छम् प्रतिष्ठ ।</strong> This is the portion of mantra in Upaniṣad while defining Ānandakośa. If Ānandakośa is identical to Brahma, then the portion of this Mantra is irrelevant. Every stage, you go to a higher level by dropping an extra of the previous Kośa. Similarly, when you forget a valuable thing at the higher level, missing of which, you come to a lower kośa. As such Ānandakośa is Brahma, but corrupt.</p>
<p>So we have looked at a beautiful prakriya enunciated in the Taittirīya Upaniṣad, where you touch the silence and show that there is silence in all of us and which is superior to vijñānakośa for the reason that it is the comforting state and is the ānandasthāna.  Ānandasthāna is the source of tremendous energy by which sequential thinking and all other values of vijñānakośa are possible because of which technology has grown.  Present civilisation is suffering because they have concluded that vijñānakośa is the ultimate and end of all.</p>
<p>Hindu thoughtprovides this missing element to the global civilization.</p>
<p>Now I will take up questions for you.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Ānandakośa is superior to Vijñānakośa and there is no question about this. Just because it is considered superior, why not we think that there is something superior to ānanda?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> If there is anything superior please point it out.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Buddha questioned this point?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> He did not.  After enlightenment he was always happy. Incidentally he gave the message of compassion to the world and asked everybody to enjoy that ānanda. Why did he advocate sanyāsa to everybody?  He said that ānanda is your very nature. Suppose you are in the sākṣībhāva, you can do any amount of work. In fact your work efficiency increases. You’re not tired at all because you are getting a tonic there. With that spirit one has to function.  Vedānta doesn’t prevent anyone from functioning. Suffering while in activity is the one that Vedānta attacks and says that it is not needed.</p>
<p>**Q.**Do we take rest to be active or are we active because we want work?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The answer would be, if activity doesn’t make you complain, go ahead.  If there is some system inside where you are doing activity in the leisurely background then go ahead. When you yourself complain, your priority must change. If you want rest but feel that the work dries you up and you complain, then this wisdom comes to your rescue. Suppose you are active and not worried about it, then it is fine, there is a safety valve mechanism or protective shield that is taking care of you.  It is working well at the deeper centres.</p>
<p>**Q.**Ānanda and vijñāna serve each other. Am I right or wrong?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> In the background of ānanda, if you are in vijñānakośa, then it is fine. There is nothing like compartments- everything is a blending, everything is in continuity. You can be stationed at various levels like-vyāpāra helplessly done or vyāpāra done without sacrificing relaxation or no vyāpāra at all. There could be phases; it is all one Brahma in different phases. Pure consciousness is one thing. Consciousness coupled with activity is another. Freedom element of consciousness is considerably lost in the animal kingdom-still worse in the plant kingdom- totally lost in the rock kingdom. A bit of freedom has flowered in the animal kingdom and plant kingdom, much more in the human beings where corticular activity has started. <u>Through the freedom of choice for doing a thing or not doing a thing, you go to regions of ānanda.   That is the tool for spiritual growth.</u></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Most of such questions get dropped off once you get the ānanda, and the mind gets relaxed.   Why?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> When we are in sākṣībhāva, Indriyā-s by themselves can perform, there being a very faint silver thread connection. For example, we are in that state of relaxation induced by the talk and discussions when we are in satang.   In satang we do not aim at getting new information at all-we talk about peace and ānanda and therefore everybody isput into that state. Satsanga is—</p>
<p><strong>तच्चिन्तनं तत्कथनमन्योन्यं तत्प्रबोधनम् ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tat-cintanaṁ tat-kathanam-anyōnyaṁ tat -prabōdhanam.</strong> (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 3-2-108)</p>
<p>I am_ _benefited now and you are also benefited as both of us are in expansive state. What is brhama abhyāsa? It is, <strong>cintana, kathana annyonya prabodhana - चिन्तन, कथन अन्न्योन्य प्रबोधन ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>एतदेकपरत्वं च तदभ्यासं विदुर्बुधाः॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ētat- ēka-paratvaṁ ca tat-abhyāsaṁ vidurbudhāḥ.</strong> (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 3-2-108)</p>
<p>Mutually inducing -you talk a word about peace, I get that, -I talk a word aboutpeace, you get that.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Are we not always in that phase?</p>
<p>**A.**It is not that easy. If you are, then you might be doing that sādhana for more than twenty years! For a fresher, this focusing has to go and he has to stabilise in the state of relaxation, then he can be really happy in spite of activity.</p>
<p>Now we say drop this focusing and hold on to the let go state.  A stage comes when let go state is in abundance and you can focus also without any botheration. This model is called peripheral focusing. It can also be called non focusing attention. Many such words can be used to represent the state. It is a matter of time and sādhana.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why can’t we start at the very early age like training a child?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> If you encourage a child to keep quiet, then it encourages the child to develop laziness more than the spiritual sādhana.   A bit of discipline, a bit of effort, a bit of persuasion, but within safe limits is necessary. Otherwise it degenerates since there is no vicāra. The child wants all the bhoga but does not want to toil for the same. Control or samyama has to be taught over a period of time and cannot be done hastily.  Samādhāna is missing in this civilization which is pushing the child into the rat race.</p>
<p>The child cannot pick up all the good vāsanā-s if left free and without any imposition from the parent.  Suggestion can be given to the child, gently and not pushing things authoritatively. Then these healthy attitudes will become stronger in the child’s mind. Unless maturity develops for discrimination, it will not be an easy path. Maithri, karuna, mudita, upekşa ideas are very good for the child’s growth, instead of selfishness, irritability, hatred.  Aśubha-vāsanā-s are to be replaced by śubha-vāsanā-s That is where our responsibility comes. Give all the ideals of Indian heritage like Dharma, Tyāga, and Nigraha.   We should inculcate these things into the child. Then the child is fit for Vedānta. If you put the child to a tight discipline, there is a break point and the child runs away to other pleasures. That is why Vedānta has to be introduced gradually.</p>
<p>To conclude our today’s discussion:</p>
<p>Now we are convinced that we should always be happy under any circumstances. But we cannot be like that because we have known the truth only by theory.  Our system is not prepared for such an immediate transformation as we are heavily conditioned. System transformation does not happen simultaneously with this knowledge because of gathered vāsanā- that is the real problem Therefore mere śāstra paricaya is not sufficient, but a phase of sādhana is required to undo the accumulated forces, which are called saṁskāra-s or vāsanā-s.  Vāsanākṣya is required (dissolving the vāsanā-s) and that is a long drawn programme. It may take many lives, but with continuous practice, improvement takes place and every decrease of vāsanā is increase of ānanda. Please take this point carefully and do not run to the conclusion that one day you will get that brāhmic state and till then the whole thing is absurd. It is a very confused position in Vedānta. Therefore, the thing what you have to look for is the increase of ānanda every day.  You should not hurry to get the brāhmic state. It will come by itself once you are ripe.</p>
