title = "02 IN SEARCH OF OUR TRUE NATURE - AN OVERVIEW"

+++

In our last talk we tried to bring out the differences between karmakāṇḍa and jñānakāṇḍa. It is possible that I have spoken lightly of karmakāṇḍa, but karmakāṇḍa is a very valuable part of Vedas. I was just showing the differences in the content, rather than emphasising the superior ways in which jñānakāṇḍa takes us in the realm of spiritual study. Whosoever has that śraddhā and devotion to karmakāṇḍa details is certainly a superior person. Please do not slacken that śraddhā, as it pays in the long run. All religious activities conceived by the Indian**R̥ṣi-s  - ऋषि**- have a very big significance in creating peace in our minds.**Śankara - शङ्कर**makes a conclusive statement about it, calling that all the religious activities are aimed at**Cittaśuddhi - चित्तशुद्धि -**cleansing of the mind. The whole of karmakāṇḍa is highly valuable because it purifies the mind and very soon we come to the realization that purified mind is**ātmā - आत्मा or Brahma - ब्रह्म.** I will be wrong if I underrate karmakāṇḍa rituals. The worship, the **pūjā - पूजा**, the **prārthanā - प्रार्थना** and the **vrata - व्रत**that every Indian home does, is equally important in the attainment of peace of mind.

Once at a couples' camp at Kanyakumari in India where eighty people had participated, I was observing a Maharaṣṭrian lady, a doctor by profession, who was constantly doing **Japa - जप** while listening to the lectures. Out of curiosity, I asked her whether it was the Maharaṣṭrian way. She replied that she always did Japa whenever she found time during the day, irrespective of the place and time. So her mind had become **Japamātra - जपमात्र**. Imagine the cittaśuddhi that could have happened to that lady when all unwanted thoughts are simply replaced by the japa. Once the mind is purified, then that is the seat of peace. A purified mind is ānanda or ātmā or Brahma.

**निगृहीतस्य मनसो निर्विकल्पस्य धीमतः।**

**Nigr̥hītasya manasō nirvikalpasya dhīmataḥ.**

(Māṇ. Up.3-Kā.34)

An assertion from a famous thinker Gauḍapāda, the grand preceptor of Śankara, **Nigr̥hītaṁ manaḥ ēva nirbhayaṁ brahma  - निगृहीतं मनः एव निर्भयं ब्रह्म  -**the fully conquered mind, the fully tamed mind is verily Brahman, the seat of bliss, the seat of ānanda.

Coming back to our point, jñānakāṇḍa is remarkable because it is scientific in every sense of the word and you all know that it appeals to us more, as we are scientific by disposition and by training. Therefore there is a good deal of matching in our thinking process. One does not have to take things for granted. Everything goes by investigation. If the points stated are established, one accepts them or else one rejects them. That’s the courage shown in jñānakāṇḍa reflecting a typical scientific temper.

Fundamental questions are posed and answers sought in Jñānakāṇḍa. Questions which are relevant to day to day life of mankind are tackled. It is a universal science catering to the needs of anybody and everybody irrespective of caste, creed, religion, nation, race etc. It need not be stressed that everyone is suffering with one or the other problem. Anyone can swear by this. Vedānta comes to the rescue of one and all and assures a total and everlasting solution to one’s suffering. It is for this reason that we should go to this science. **Ātyantika duḥkha nivāraṇa, niratiśaya sukhaprāpti - आत्यन्तिक दुःख निवारण, निरतिशय सुखप्राप्ति**(cessation of perennial suffering and attainment of unbounded happiness) is the motto of that science. Upaniṣad-s themselves declare this point. A person after self examination can actually discover his true nature and come out of sorrow automatically. A student comes and asks the teacher:

**कस्मिन्नु भगवो विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवतीति ।**

**Kasminnu bhagavō vijñātē sarvaṁ-idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati-iti.** (Muṇḍaka Upa. 1-1-3)

O master, give that knowledge knowing which everything is known. This jigsaw puzzle is completely solved once you are a sādhaka as enumerated in Muṇḍaka Upa. (2-2-9) thus:

**भिद्यते हृदयग्रन्थिश्छिद्यन्ते सर्वसंशयाः।**

**क्षीयन्ते चास्य कर्माणि तस्मिन् दृष्टे परावरे॥**

**Bhidyatē hr̥dayagranthiḥ-chidyantē sarva-saṁśayāḥ,**

**kṣīyantē ca-asya karmāṇi tasmin dr̥ṣṭē parāvarē.**

**Bhidyatē hr̥dayagranthiḥ _-_**

The pressure at the **Ājñācakra**, at the optic centre (space_ _between the eye brows) is totally relieved.**_ _**

**Chidyantē sarvasaṁśayāḥ**

To a student of Vedānta, this knot of bondage is completely cut. All doubts are cleared.

And, what else?**kṣīyantē cā asya karmāṇi.** Everybody has a load of karma on his shoulders. Upaniṣadic wisdom shows that karma is not the ultimate. We are under the belief that only money fetching and objects of enjoyment thereof, brings us sukha. Śāstra proves that all this is not necessary for the end point. Kṣīyante chāsya karmāni-the load of karma simply gets dropped here.

When? **tasmin dr̥ṣṭē parāvarē-**When you know the mechanism by which the phenomenon turns into non phenomenon, when you can catch this reversible reaction, the creation phase versus the dissolution phase - **ātmasthiti - आत्मस्थिति**, all the gains come to you. So this philosophy by which this **duḥkhanāśa - दुःखनाश** – eradication of duḥkha happens is the main feature of Vedānta. If we keep this in mind, yesterday's objection on karmakāṇḍa can be forgotten.  As Nārada puts it-

**शोकम् तरति आत्मविदिति ---**

**Śōkam tarati ātmaviditi ---**Chāndogya Upa. 7-1-3)

With the knowledge of Self one can overcome grief.

Let us now try to understand how Vedānta goes about the above subject. It asks the person to investigate - do Parīkṣa. Whatever the inside forces are and whatever the inside phenomena are, observe them. The following beautiful stanza from Kaţhopaniṣhad (2-4-1) is worth elaborating and contemplating.:

**पराञ्चि खानि व्यतृणत्स्वयंभूस्तस्मात्पराङ्पश्यति नान्तरात्मन्।**

**कश्चित् धीरः प्रत्यगात्मानमैक्षत् आवृत्तचक्षुः अमृतत्वमिच्छन्॥**

**Parāñci khāni vyatr̥ṇat-svayaṁbhūḥ-tasmāt parān-paśyati na-antarātman.**

**Kaścit dhīraḥ pratyagātmānam-aikṣat āvr̥tta-cakṣuḥ amr̥tatvam-icchan.**



* Parāncikhāni_ _vyatṛṇat_ _svayambhuḥ_ _tasmāt_ _parān_ _paśyati_ _na_ _antarātman - The Creator has created the indriyā-s in man which are directed outwardly. He has structured them as if they go out always, look for things of pleasure. Hence we are always thinking of the outside world transacting through the Jñānendriyā-s.
* Kaścit dhīraḥ- Once in a way, a bold person is born who takes the centre stage. What does he do?
* Āvṛtta cakṣuḥ pratyagātmānam aikṣhata- He reverses the process. He turns the Indriyā-s inwards with his intellect. The tool of investigation turned inside, he conducts the search. Why does he do that?
* amṛtatvam icchan - To get everlasting happiness.

Such a hero was Nachiketha of Kaţhopaniṣad, who at his sixteenth year seriously sought answers from Yama to such deeper questions. This also goes to show that one has to search for truths at a very early age. Mainly two methods of investigation are suggested for this purpose. We will look at them one by one.

**1.Ātmaparīkṣā-आत्मपरीक्षा**–**Self Examination.**

I will narrate an incident from Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad -**बृहदारण्यक उपनिषत्**.

Yājñavalkya **– याज्ञवल्क्य** - is the great preceptor, the hero of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad. He decides to take formal sanyāsa to enable him to do the sādhana for attainment of the reality he has theoretically und -erstood. To take sanyāsa, one should seek the permission of the wife. So naturally Yājñavalkya also had to do the same. He had two wives**Kātyāyanī - कात्यायनी**, and**Maitreyī- मैत्रेयी**. He goes to Kātyāyani, the elder wife and assures her that he will equally divide his wealth acquired from King Janaka so that both of them could be happy. Kātyāyani permits him to take sanyāsa as she is happy with the wealth provided for. Then he goes to Maitreyi and repeats the assurance given to the other wife and asks her permission to take sanyāsa. Maitreyi, on the other hand, questions him if the riches given by him would fetch permanent happiness. Yājñavalkya tells her the truth that riches cannot give permanent happiness.

**अमृतत्वस्य न आशा अस्ति वित्तेन**। - (Bṛha. Upa. 2-4-2)

**Amr̥tatvasya na āśā asti vittēna**

Riches can give comfort, but amṛtatva is impossible. Permanent joy, unbroken joy, undiluted joy, uninterrupted joy is not possible. Maitreyi says that she wants permanent happiness, if he can give her, other than the money. She wants the method by which she can get the**śāśvatasukha.**

The answer given by Yājñavalkya is the very famous vedāntic thought and also the method by which one can gain undiluted happiness. If one wants to be happy always, the only way is to know oneself.

**आत्मा वा अरे द्रष्टव्यः श्रोतव्यः मन्तव्यः निदिध्यासितव्यः।**

**Ātmā vā arē draṣṭavyaḥ śrōtavyaḥ mantavyaḥ nididhyāsitavyaḥ.** (Bṛha Upa. 2-4-5)

My dear (Maitreyi), Self should be heard of, reflected on and meditated upon.

The gist of Vedānta has been condensed into one sentence and a prescription is given. Are you really interested in Sukha? Total Sukha? Then why don’t you do ātmāparīkṣa? But, what is ātmā and why parīkṣa? A wonderful explanation is given by Yajñavalkya as under ((Bṛha Upa. 2-4-5)

**न वा अरे पत्युः कामाय पतिः प्रियो भवति, आत्मनस्तु कामाय पतिः प्रियो भवति। न वा अरे जायायै कामाय जाया प्रिया भवति, आत्मनस्तु कामाय जाया प्रिया भवति। .............. न वा अरे लोकानां कामाय लोकाः ...... न वा अरे सर्वस्य कामाय सर्वं ...**

**Na vā arē patyuḥ kāmāya patiḥ priyō bhavati, ātmanastu kāmāya patiḥ priyō bhavati| na vā arē jāyāyai kāmāya jāyā priyā bhavati, ātmanastu kāmāya jāyā priyā bhavati| .............. na vā arē lōkānāṁ kāmāya lōkāḥ ...... na vā arē sarvasya kāmāya sarvaṁ...**

Verily, not for the sake of the husband is the husband loved, but he is loved for the sake of the self. Not for the sake of the wife is the wife loved, but she is loved for the sake of the self. Not for the sake of the sons, my dear, are the sons loved, but they are loved for the sake of the self.

Likewise, not for the sake of wealth, animals, world, everyone... are all loved. But, they are loved for the sake of the self.

Husband is dear to the wife not for husband’s sake, but for her own sake. Similar is the case with the husband. Wife is important as long as she satisfies him. Husband is comfortable because of his wife since she is interesting to him. If each says that the other is important for other’s sake, it is self deceit. One holds Vedas high not because they are reverential, but because they give one the comfort. Activities like social service, scientific research, etc. are noble and beneficial to the society. People involved in such activities seem to be under the impression that they are doing so for the sake of activities. In reality, these activities are dear to the persons involved as they give comfort, joy, satisfaction and happiness to them personally. If any activity does not contribute to one’s stock of happiness, one will not do that. Therefore, what is that atman (self) to which all your concerns are really directed? This atman or this reference point, for whose delight you are seeing worthwhileness in all things/activities, is to be found out.

So the first method of investigation is ātmaparīkṣā under the guidance of a competent teacher. Who is a competent teacher? Scriptures are very careful in prescribing the rules for that.

**तद्विज्ञानार्थं स गुरुमेवाभिगच्छेत्।**

**समित्पाणिः श्रोत्रियम् ब्रह्मनिष्ठम्॥-**Muṇḍaka Upa.1-2-12.

**Tat-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum-ēva-abhigacchēt,**

**samitpāṇiḥ śrōtriyam brahma-niṣṭham.**

For the attainment of knowledge of SELF one has to approach the teacher who is not only a scholar but also is established in Brahman.

A competent teacher is one who should have double qualifications. There are two eligibility factors. What are they? He must be well versed with the śāstrā-s. That alone is not sufficient, because he may be repeating the śāstra in a parrot like way, without himself being a brahmaniṣṭha_,_ without having touched the source. So, while śrotriyatva_ _is necessary, brahmaniṣṭhatva is also necessary. He must have known the truth, not only by śāstrarūpeņa but also by anubhavarūpeņa_. _The two factors put together are necessary to be a teacher.

**2. Sukha-Duḥkha Parīkṣa- सुखदुःखपरीक्षा ।**

This is the second method suggested by the śāstra. As already discussed in the introductory talk, every person craves for more and more happiness or sukha. At the same time, he wants to get rid of suffering or duḥkha. He is continuously and constantly struggling for sukha-prāpti and duḥkha-nivṛtti. In order to know the truth, Vedānta asks the student to do the parīkṣa of duḥkha or sukha, as the case may be, in greater depth. That is, one has to delve deep into the problem itself and find the solution by analysing the same to its minute details.

Before we get into the discussions it should be clearly borne in mind that our entire deliberations relate to **Mental Level** or the Psychic Level or Citta Level or Intellectual Level and not at physical level.
