(AN ANALYSIS OF HAPPINESS AND SUFFERING)

The credit of discovering this path definitely has to go to me. In my days of intense suffering, I was frantically searching for solutions in Vedānta śāstrās by thorough study of the texts along with the invaluable commentary by Śankara on them. This in-depth search of mine led to the discovery of the above path. When presented in the public, many took it with disbelief and they naturally wanted sanction in Vedāntic Texts or Śāstra Pramāna. In Chāndogya Upaniṣad (7-22) Sanatkumāra (the teacher) tells Nārada (the student) that:

**यदा वै सुखं लभतेऽथ करोति।**

**Yadā vai sukhaṁ labhate atha karōti.**

One will involve oneself in that activity only which gives him Sukha or happiness.

**सुखं लब्ध्वा करोति - Sukhaṁ labdhvā karōti.**

One will not venture into that activity which will not result in happiness.

**सुखमेव लब्ध्वा करोति।**

**Sukham-ēva labdhvā karōti.**

One is goaded into an activity if he gets only happiness.

**सुखंत्वेव विजिज्ञासितव्यमिति ।**

**Sukhaṁtvēva vijijñāsitavyam-iti.**

Hence, we have to investigate or do the parīkṣa of sukha only. Therefore the student requests the teacher:

**सुखं भगवो विजिज्ञास इति॥**

**Sukhaṁ bhagavō vijijñāsa iti.**

Oh my Lord, let me know about the secrets of Sukha.

In Taittirīya Upaniṣad, (2-8) the aspect of Ānanda or Happiness or Sukha is discussed in detail: 

**सैषानन्दस्य मीमांसा भवति।**

**Sa-ēṣa-ānandasya mīmāṁsā bhavati.**

The teacher calls the student for an investigation of ānanda.

When the teacher suggests sukha-duḥkha parīkṣa, the student immediately reacts, saying that everything about sukha and duḥkha is known already. What more is there to be studied? Look at the reaction of the student. He can categorically tell what his knowledge about sukha-duḥkha is. He declares that he knows about sukha in the sense that music gives him joy, a sweet dish gives him joy, company of welcome friends gives him joy, and a very understanding wife gives him joy. If these are not available, then he is not happy. He further elaborates that if his son/daughter is not studious, he is not happy. Pleasant situations give him joy. Indriya āsvādana gives him joy. The contact of five indriyā-s with the corresponding viṣayā-s, give him joy. The minus of that puts him into sorrow. So, he declares that he knows everything about sukha and duḥkha.

The teacher sets aside the conclusions drawn by the student. He wants the student to investigate Sukha and Duḥkha **content wise and not agency wise.** Here one should pause a little, contemplate and try to catch the difference between knowing the thing agency wise and the same thing content wise. The general opinion is that certain things put one in a happy mood and certain other things put one in an unhappy mood. This was not the study the teacher wanted the student to go into. **He wanted the student to closely watch his state of mind when the student declared that he was happy. Similarly, the teacher wanted the student to study the Cittasthiti (mental state) when he felt he was unhappy.**

This type of investigation, none of us have tried when we are in moments of sukha or duḥkha. Instead, we had restricted our studies of happy or unhappy state at the indriya level all the time. That is all the study we made. Content-wise we have to examine what is sukha and what is duḥkha. We should observe this difference. What was my mental state when I said that the whole of Sunday was a bad day? What is my mental state when I say that it is beautiful, I am so fine? This parīkṣa may look very simple, but it has not occurred to anybody in the world to do the parīkṣa this way. It is exclusively the suggestion from the Upaniṣads. No philosopher, no system of philosophy could give it in such simple terms. In no religion or practice it has been emphasised that sukha-duḥkha parīkṣa should be on the lines where you examine the state of the mind when you are happy and the state of the mind when you are not happy.**The suggestion is unique to the Upaniṣads**. What is the psychological state, what is the psychological posture when you are happy and when you are not happy? A very simple examination but it is a very profound one. It can take you to a new discovery. That’s why I mentioned yesterday that Vedanta is a difficult science, but when properly understood, it is the easiest of all the sciences.
