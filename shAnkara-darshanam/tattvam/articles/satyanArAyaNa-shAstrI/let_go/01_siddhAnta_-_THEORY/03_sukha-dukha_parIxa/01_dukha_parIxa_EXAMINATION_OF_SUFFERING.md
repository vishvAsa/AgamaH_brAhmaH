title = "01 DUḤKHA PARĪKṣA (EXAMINATION OF SUFFERING)"

+++

Let us take up duḥkha parīkṣa to start with and later on go to sukha parīkṣa. What is Duḥkha parīkṣa? Take any duḥkha moment and see what the cittasthiti is. That’s all. Every day we have many moments of duḥkha. Observe what is the state of the mind at that time? Take the case of the day previous to the examination results of a student. The parents of the person are anxious and the student is anxious. The student’s interest is either to get into the computer science course or to get into the medical course, because they are the highest paying jobs. Just imagine the state of parent’s mind or the student’s mind and identify yourself with that situation. Oh! Would I get my first class? Will I lose that? All my plans will be broken if I don’t get it. Would it be a donation seat? Or would it be a seat earned on merit? What then? What are the alternatives? I have such high expectations about the result.

What's the nature of mind at that time? Anxiety! Insecurity! Fear! Doubt! The student wants to relax, but he cannot. He or she is agitated, disturbed. See the revised way of studying duḥkha, not constituent-wise, not ingredients-wise, not characteristics-wise,

The most powerful example that I always remember to illustrate, is to imagine the mental state of your wife or daughter or your sister when a baby is about to be delivered in the family. Admitted to the hospital/ nursing home, the lady is moved to the operation theatre. Watch the husband or father or the mother of the lady in question. They are all anxious, moving up and down the corridor of the hospital. Would it be a simple labour case? Would it be a forceps case? Would it be a caesarean case? Would the child and the mother be safe? The state of mind of the concerned person, when observed, points to **Uncertainty, Anxiety, Impatience, Fear,**which are all attributes of duḥkha.

Similarly, Rāga-attraction, Dveṣa-repulsion, Bhaya-fear, are also facets of duḥkha. Jealousy comes when you have only one car and your neighbour has more than that. You grudge him. You feel small. It's that inferiority complex that bothers you- this is a duḥkha attribute. Mind is agitated, excited and troubled. You try to further see the common factor through a scientist's eye-that is, to reduce many things into as few things as possible.

It is a wellestablished fact in Vedānta that the entire set of activities of a human being, both physical and psychological, are nothing butPrāṇic Activity only. Prāṇa is defined as ‘Gatiḥ Prāṇaḥ’-** गतिः प्राणः**. Movement is Prāṇa. Movement is vibration or pulsation. Chāndogya Upaniṣad declares that:

**…स यदा स्वपिति प्राणमेव वागप्येति । प्राणं चक्षुःप्राणं श्रोत्रं प्राणं मनः प्राणोह्येवैतान् सर्वान् संवृङ्क्त इति।**

**…sa yadā svapiti prāṇam-ēva vāk-apyēti.  prāṇaṁ cakṣuḥ prāṇaṁ śrōtraṁ prāṇaṁ manaḥ prāṇō-hi-ēva-ētān sarvān saṁvr̥ṅkta iti.**

 (Chāndogya Upa. 4-3-3)**  **

When a person is in deep sleep his speech gets merged into general prāṇic activity. Likewise his seeing, hearing, thinking, etc. - i.e., all his physical and psychological activities - merge into a single prāṇic activity or a general vibration.

The above can be easily grasped if we think of a person who is in coma. Except the beating of the pulse there is no other activity in him. All other physical and mental activities stand merged in this mere pulsation- general prāṇic activity.



* Our thinking centre (centre of our mind which is called as Citta) is filled with Prāṇaic Activity, Vibration or Movement.
* Any activity involves variation in its occurrence – it may be very slow, slow, normal, fast, very fast etc.

As already discussed above, the teacher’s direction of investigating Duḥkha is to watch the state of mind when one says that he is not happy or is suffering. Accordingly, if one examines his own mind or Citta Centre when he is angry it is highly agitated, the level of activity is at a very high speed, there is fastness, there is restlessness, citta is filled with throbbing prānic activity. Although he is not in a position to watch his state of mind at the peak of his anger, he can do so when he calms down a little. We would have seen people physically disturbed and even trembling during such angry situations. When we analyse this, we can say that Rāga, Krodha (Anger), Jealousy, Bhaya (fear), Anxiety, Uncertainty, Impatience, Hurry etc., are all synonyms of **SPEED** only. All these situations amount to fastness or hyper activity of the mind (citta) called **VEGA** in Sanskrit. Thus, all such moments are moments of Duḥkha or suffering. Let us take up the following Śloka of Bhagavad-Ġīta (5-23).

**शक्नोतीहैव यः सोढुं प्राक्शरीरविमोक्षणात् ।**

**कामक्रोधोद्भवं वेगं स युक्तः स सुखी नर:॥**

**Śaknōti-iha-ēva yaḥ sōḍhuṁ prāk-śarīra- vimōkṣaṇāt,**

**Kāma-krōdha-udbhavaṁ vēgaṁ sa yuktaḥ sa sukhī naraḥ.**

One who is able to withstand the impulse of lust and anger before death is a yogi, and a happy person.Man can be happy only when he is able to control or drop the speed arising out of Kāma (desire), Krodha, and Bhaya etc. which are the moments of Duḥkha.

**दुःखेष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः।**

**वीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते॥**

**Duḥkhēṣu-anudvigna-manāḥ sukhēṣu vigata- spr̥haḥ,**

**vīta-rāga-bhaya-krōdhaḥ sthitadhīḥ- muniḥ-ucyatē.** (Bhagavad-Ġīta, 2-56)

A person whose mind is unperturbed by sorrow, who does not crave for pleasures, and who is completely free from attachment, fear, and anger, is called Sthitaprajña --- a sage of steady intellect.

In Bhagavad-Ġīta, while dealing with the characteristics of a balanced person or Yogi it is said that – such a person will not get disturbed, his mind does not get agitated or his mind is rid of Vega during the moments of Duḥkha. That is, he has conquered the speed of Rāga, Bhaya, and Krodha in all such situations.

When examined, one can see that any disturbance, any misery, and any pain amounts to violence inside- it can be an excited mind, an agitated mind with unruly forces operating inside. If you apply the cleverness of a scientist, all these can be brought under one term –**speed or vega** or fastness. That’s the advantage the scientist has over the others. He can bring all these things into a few minimal terms. Hundreds of nearly different things can be brought into one term, so that handling is easy. So,**duḥkha is speed**. What a permitted conclusion!

**Hence, the solution** is, wherever there is fastness, replace it by slowness. It is our experience that an agitated person instead of walking will almost be running. A speed at one point is a speed revealed everywhere. If he is fast inside and is chewing, it can be fast chewing. If he is swallowing, it is fast swallowing. My relative who was a specialist in cancer layer study in Cincinnati, USA, had the habit of chewing the gum. When he focussed and when he was fast, this speed of chewing also increased. He had observed this and shared with me. He was not a student of Vedānta, but look at the observation.

<u>Speed felt at one centre is revealed at all centres. Speed corrected at one centre, purifies all other centres</u>. Now that you have the answer-walk slowly- talk slowly-think slowly. Try to get angry slowly. Then it is no anger at all! Softness brought at one centre induces softness at other centres like the thinking centre, the walk centre, the talk centre and the respiratory centre. Try to apply slowness and see the difference. Comfort sets in immediately. I have tried this experiment and got results. You can best appreciate this truth when you start applying them. You can see the difference and appreciate the śāstra then. If you want to walk, do it slowly. Walking slowly starts purifying all these centres. Then one is very much relaxed.

There is another component of duḥkha, which we have to study. In fact it is a subtler aspect. Once you become an intellectual, you begin to think seriously. And what's that thinking - to know, to understand, to grasp. That’s again another burden. Why do you call it a burden? Is it not the power in you? Intellect is the best tool in the hands of man. All this technology is because of his intellect. Employing that intellect, the medical science has advanced. Anaesthesia itself has become so sophisticated that it is very convenient to surgery. A roof can be bent in any direction because of the combination of concrete and reinforcements. All this technology is the result of focussing_. _But the point is that it is burdensome and that is the reason why focussing is turned down by śāstra. One is naturally disturbed with this position of śāstra and this can be anybody’s objection to the śāstra. Focussing is the most powerful tool in the hands of man due to which the advancement of technology is possible. But the point is that this attention or focussing is burdensome. Fortunately, we are making and breaking this focussing. Nobody is continuously concentrating for more than half an hour, even the most studious. Even the big researcher reaches the break down point very early. The fatigue point is reached and he shakes off. That’s a natural safety mechanism built in man. Otherwise, man would have broken himself down, would have turned mad, and would have hit himself against a wall! You shift from the serious mood to a lighter mood. But once you start encouraging this quality of overdoing this focussing, the balance is tilted. Generally, we err in the wrong direction and we begin to suffer.

Imagine the fatigue experience of such a person. We must know the goodness or badness of a thing in its exaggerated version. Otherwise it becomes difficult to appreciate! You must push the pendulum to the extreme point and then see the momentum it carries. But, once you exploit this intellect and start doing much of it, you begin to suffer. Excitement, fear, desire for objects of enjoyment, desire for fame; can be managed to certain extent. But the endless pursuit for creativity is difficult to manage. If you watch the professors in any research institute, either they are in the laboratory doing research or they are stuck in their home also preoccupied with the same thought of research. They cannot come out of this focussing. Hence, subtler version of suffering is **focussing.** Basically we are ‘all-pervasive’ beings or** sarvayvāpī- सर्वव्यापी.**



* When you are not in suffering state you are expansive, unloaded, diffused, very light, and non-dense and hence you are in a state of Vistārata- all-pervasiveness.
* But when you are in a moment of Duḥkha, you are sacrificing your everywhereness and coming to a pinpoint.
* In the language of a Quantum Physicist – you are in a **CONING**phase- tending towards pointedness.
* If one observes a cone, the tip of the cone is pointed and the base is wide.
* Focussing is coning into a point. Reducing to a point or to an aperture.
* Since you are a burdened stuff, your mind acquires the highest density because it has limited volume- That is why you feel the load on you.
* We have sacrificed our true nature of expansive state and are badly caught up in searching, trying to solve, trying to know etc. We have shrunk ourselves into a narrow stuff.

Unaware of this obvious truth, I made a mess of my life for 20 years, always focussing, to a point that I lost my sleep, I lost my appetite, and no medication would help me. I went to a very famous doctor only to be told that no medicine would help me and I had to gain balance of mind through control of aspirations. I was always researching on something or the other. I was having a firm faith and conviction that I was doing a very big thing or a noble act.

I am showing a very big aspect of human being, especially that of an intellectual. I was proud of my research skills. I thought I was a big fellow because I could easily focus on various things. All the while I was under the impression that I was doing the best thing - solving problems – such as, how to give a simpler house for the villager with which I was not concerned at all as I was a chemistry professor. My research was to device a method to simplify a house construction and make it cost effective. How to avoid a beam for the door and have only the shutter, how to avoid plastering for the wall so that it could save 20% of the total cost, how to build a house without foundation? It was not my field at all. Even then, I had designed all carpentry work. You may say that it is a wonderful research for society's benefit and for one’s own delight, but it was exhausting for me.

I owe everything to Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa because I was able to open the knot of suffering. I deeply understood the vedāntic solution when no teacher could tell me what my problem was and where I erred. Most of the teachers went by vedāntic definitions Satyam Jñānam Anantam Brahma, Anoranīyān Mahatomahīāyn, etc. Once again, if you become a serious student and start studying these declarations you will end up confused. What does one understand by saying ‘you are smaller than the smallest, bigger than the biggest’ (Anoranīyān, Mahatomahīyān)? To a scientist that is a very big inconsistency. How can anything simultaneously be smaller than the smallest and bigger than the biggest?

One of my friends was a director of a computer science research centre. He was in his fifties, heading twenty top scientists and was the chief of the unit. While we were discussing one day, he said that he had become prematurely ten years older due to pressure of work and focussing. An American, who was a big researcher, head of a team of researchers, confessed to the fact that he was 10 years older than his actual age. Then why not give it up? See the difficulty. How can he give up, as the investor of money into that research unit is demanding results? The investor or money giver claims results. Otherwise there is a fear of the funds being stopped. So, that leads to more and more focussing. What next? How to complete this research in one or two weeks? Though it can be a remarkable achievement from one point of view it is alarming from the other point of view.

We cannot say that focussing - **ēkāgratā- एकाग्रता,**is a wrong thing, but ekāgratā was my cause for suffering when I overdid it although it gave me good credit for an extraordinary performance.

I want you to appreciate this point. The world of technology and the civilization has missed this big point. While we may glorify it from one point of view, we should condemn it from the other point of view. The urge to over perform through attention or concentration is a killer of peace! You are paying a big price for your technological achievements. Why should not people here in America realize this one? Look at the wisdom from the East? At what cost are you getting these achievements-new discoveries, especially in the medical field and in the engineering field. If there is adequate rest for the **buddhikośa- बुद्धिकोश –**the intellect**- **it is okay. This is the missing element in the 21<sup>st</sup> century civilization. And what is the technique that can complement that missing element? It is the Indian wisdom- the Vedāntic wisdom. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (3-9-39) asserts-

**अनास्थैव हि निर्वाणम् दुःखमास्था परिग्रहः।**

**Anāsthā-ēva hi nirvāṇam duḥkham-āsthā parigrahaḥ.**

While attachment (focussing) is sufferring, detachment (diffusion) alone leads to liberation.

Focussing, pinpointedness, concentration, coning, etc. all result in untold suffering or Duḥkha. Whereas, Vistārata or diffusion or expansive state of mind gives you Sukha or happiness or deliverance from Duḥkha. Therefore drop burdensome/tiresome focussing and concentration and adopt a**Let go attitude** as far as possible. This is called **Udāsīnabhāva- उदासीनभाव.**

This focussing is the main aspect of Duḥkha for an intellectual. The duḥkha of a non intellectual or worldly person is to hanker for small things such as satisfaction of the tongue, attainment of status and recognition etc. Even the role of the social worker is to think about the ways of serving the society. What about the householder then? He worries about the children, about the wife, about the bank deposit? How does it help him to come out of duḥkha? As said in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (6-9-418)-

**द्वित्वैकत्वदृशौ चित्तं तदेवाज्ञानमुच्यते।**

**एतयोर्यो लयो दृष्टयोस्तज्ज्ञानं सा परा गतिः॥**

**Dvitva-ēkatva-dr̥śau cittaṁ tat-ēva-ajñānam- ucyatē,**

**ētayōryō layō dr̥ṣṭayō-tat-jñānaṁ sā parā gatiḥ.**

That itself is ignorance if eirher the mind cognises several objects at a time or concentrates on one object only. If both these modes of the mind dissolve then that is the highest and exalted state.

If cāncalya is a bandhana then ēkāgratā also is a bandhana. When these are put an end to, then that is liberation.

Anyway, **speed and focussing** are the two aspects of duḥkha. It is a very big piece of research whatever we have discussed in these ten minutes. Duḥkha is completely understood through these two words- speed - **vega- वेग**and focussing (Lakshya). Thus, duḥkha is either an agitated state of mind or a focussed state of mind. <u>If agitation is replaced by **naidhānya- नैधान्य**, gradually and consciously it will result in less and less of duḥkha. Whenever focussing becomes burdensome, replace the same by de-focussing or diffusion (‘let go’ attitude - udāsīnabhāva).</u> And again the result will be elimination of duḥkha. More you diffuse, more will be the expansion of your shell. Ramaṇa and R<u>ā</u>makṛṣṇa would often say 'I don’t know where I exist. I am not centred.' The point here is that they did not even know where they were. To that extent the diffusion had taken place. We identify ourselves with some place or work as a reference point when we ask ourselves as to where we are. Whereas, a Jñāni would say that he cannot see himself and confirms that he has lost his focus. That’s the experiential announcement of a jñāni.

As doctors put it, half the remedy is achieved by proper diagnosis. So if you are convinced that the points raised above are the symptoms of Duḥkha, then replace**Vēga by slowness and focussing by expansion**. This is the solution to the problem of duḥkha. That was our research to come out of duḥkha. Sankochatā or constriction or narrowing down is replaced by Vistāratā-**विस्तारता** -everywhereness, spreadness.

That’s where a scientist is at an advantage over the pundit as far as Vedānta is concerned. We are at a distinct advantage than our forefathers who did not know this vocabulary. They did not know this scientific phraseology because they didn’t know aspects like density, potential etc. Duḥkha is localization. Non localized- spread version is the solution for the state of burden. So once you know this, you have the answer.

**<u>Role of One’s Freedom Element</u>.**

The student appreciates the whole point and expresses that he is fully convinced about the solution for duḥkha. But, he urges that not to be fast and not to focus is not under his control. The main objection is that situations drive a person mad. There are a number of problems to be attended to simultaneously within limited period of time and this cannot be avoided. Logically, this is a valid point to consider. In the language of psychology, one is determined by the stimulus-response theory. There is the stimulus, there is the situation and one has to respond helplessly. Many examples can be considered. Take the case of a household lady. She is suffering because her husband is very indifferent to domestic work. How do you expect her to be comfortable and relaxed? It is an attack on the whole study we made here.

Psychological transactions are not just governed by the law of stimulus and response. A new factor comes into the study and it is the**freedom** element. You have a choice, you have a freedom, and you have an option. It is not deterministic. Till now, you never thought so. In fact this is the ignorance on the part of man. Everyone thinks that the situations are so demanding that they drive one to suffering. Although one knows the answer, still it cannot be applied. This is a very important objection.

It is here that I did a bit of deeper research. It is here that text books in psychology can take a fresh lesson from Vedānta. One is the theoretical aspect and the other is the application part of it. Śāstra says man is not a creature of circumstances. He can react or he can refuse to react. The situations cannot thrust themselves on him. The option is with him, the freedom is within him, the choice is with him.

Śankara’s brilliant research gives us the truth. What is mind? Mind is a very peculiar thing and it has this capacity:

**कर्तुं अकर्तुं अन्यथा वा कर्तुं शक्यम् ।**

**Kartuṁ akartuṁ anyathā vā kartuṁ śakyam.**

(Śankara, Brahmasutrabhāṣya)

A person has an inherent freedom to do, not to do or to do it differently.

What a wonderful truth! The mind can do this way, it can do the other way, it can do neither this way nor that way, it can stay quiet .For example, one can be harsh to one’s parents or one can be soft, thinking that they deserve his respects since they are elders. Alternatively, one can be neither harsh nor soft and can be neutral.

Here is the difference between the **jaḍa** and the **cetana,**the inanimate and the animate. In the case of a **jaḍavastu** like football- it cannot manipulate itself. When left in a place for fifty thousand years, it stays there. It cannot vary by itself. If one pushes, then it moves. It is a helpless mass, it has no choice. It is governed totally by the stimulus and response.

**Cetana**on the other hand, has the freedom of action, a facility not available with jaḍavastu. Let us say – a fellow has hurt me. I have a reason to get into depression or hit back with anger. Or, I can as well say ‘let him have his own opinion, why should I bother?’ **The evil forces dissolve by applying the second suggestion.**This is the available freedom in us.

To say that the external situations determine one’s mental state is a wrong thing. With the recognition of the freedom element in him, a person can have a strong volition, will or autonomy. Everyone’s home becomes beautiful if he can grow as wise as this. Any difference of opinion can be accepted. An opinion suggested by the other person may be foolish. But one need not be disturbed by that because of the freedom element human beings have. Look at the contribution of Vedānta to individual suffering and therefore to global suffering!

I can put this one argument into the textual language. <u>This freedom of choice can be applied even with regard to my three natural phases of existence namely, jnāt</u>ṛ<u>tva or perceiving, bhokt</u>ṛ<u>tva or selecting and ka</u>r<u>tṛtva or doing. I could use these qualities or I could be without them.</u> Śāstra is not forcefully thrusting something on you. This is the result of an investigation which we have done. Hence, I am pure consciousness, chinmātra svarūpa- not disturbed, not affected by situations. The individual should recognise and apply this freedom element inbuilt in him to come out of suffering.
