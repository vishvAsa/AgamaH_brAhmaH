  <meta property="og:description" content="Now let us examine the concept of Sukha as understood by our R̥ṣi-s. One may say that Duḥkharāhitya or absence of Duḥkha is not Sukha. It is the general notion that Sukha is positive and comes from:
Objects of enjoyment – Bhogasukha- Enjoyment derived through the five senses – sense of vision, hearing, smell, taste and touch. Social Service – serving the poor, disabled, economically challenged etc. It may be any activity – either trivial or profound. Job satisfaction. Satisfaction in one’s profession. Achieving name and fame in society. All the above give you positive feeling. So, what is there to examine? Why at all we should bother about investigating Sukha? The experience of almost all of us, especially the persons who are internally sensitive, is that there is saturation in every kind of worldly Sukha/happiness. Everything becomes stale at some point of time or the other. Hence, the search for everlasting happiness or pure ānanda or śāśvatasukha becomes necessary. Unfortunately we are all searching for this in the outside world. Here comes Vedānta to our rescue and asks us to investigate any moment of happiness, content wise and not agency wise.">

  <p>Now let us examine the concept of Sukha as understood by our R̥ṣi-s. One may say that Duḥkharāhitya or absence of Duḥkha is not Sukha. It is the general notion that Sukha is positive and comes from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Objects of enjoyment – Bhogasukha- Enjoyment derived through the five senses – sense of vision, hearing, smell, taste and touch.</li>
<li>Social Service – serving the poor, disabled, economically challenged etc. It may be any activity – either trivial or profound.</li>
<li>Job satisfaction.</li>
<li>Satisfaction in one’s profession.</li>
<li>Achieving name and fame in society.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the above give you positive feeling. So, what is there to examine? Why at all we should bother about investigating Sukha? The experience of almost all of us, especially the persons who are internally sensitive, is that there is saturation in every kind of worldly Sukha/happiness. Everything becomes stale at some point of time or the other. Hence, the search for everlasting happiness or pure ānanda or śāśvatasukha becomes necessary. Unfortunately we are all searching for this in the outside world. Here comes Vedānta to our rescue and asks us to investigate any moment of happiness, <u>content wise and not agency wise.</u></p>
<p>The observation or watching is to be done at the thinking centre i.e., Citta or mind Centre, as we had done with Duḥkha Moments. We have to observe the mind as to what happens at the moments of sukha and observation has to happen at the ājñāchakra or the space between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>Sip a cup of coffee or tea or listen to music of your choice or taste a sweet dish and see what happens at the thinking centre. <strong>Shift your attention from the agency, that is, coffee or music or sweet dish</strong>to the <strong>thinking Centre</strong> and just <strong>Watch.</strong> For the first time in your life you will experience a wonder. Bulk of the mind does not exist during that moment, the mind cannot think of any problems, the mind refuses to think, the mind doesn’t want to think, the mind is incapacitated to think at that moment of joy. World doesn’t exist for you. Your problems are thrown out and you are carefree- you are free of any responsibility. The burning problems that you had all along cannot touch you now in the enjoyment of coffee, or sweets or whatever.</p>
<p>You have touched your pūrvasthiti/amanī- bhāva/manorāhitya/cittaviśrānti. You are in your<strong>ātmāsvarūpa- आत्मस्वरूप</strong>. You are set in your brahmasvarūpa. You are in your no-mind state. You are in your thought free state which is your <strong>nijasvarūpa- निजस्वरूप</strong>. Here, you may disagree to accept that Bhogasukha is<strong>Brahmasukha- ब्रह्मसुख</strong>. But śāstra and Śankara mention it in a different way. Now you listen to bhāṣhya from Śankara.</p>
<p><strong>Laukikōpi ānandō brahmānandasya ēva mātrā.</strong></p>
<p><strong>लौकिकोपि आनन्दो ब्रह्मानन्दस्यैव मात्रा॥</strong></p>
<p>(Taittirīya Upa, Śankarabhāṣya, 2-8-197)</p>
<p>Don’t you see that this bhogasukha is only a fraction of that brahmasukha? What a daring statement! Is it not obvious? This means that every moment of sukha is an empty state of mind which is&ndash;Your kāraṇasthiti-Your advaita sthiti- a non dual state- a no-mind state. There is nothing like noble sukha and ignoble sukha. The agency may be noble, or ignoble. But sukha per se is Brahma. And Śankara actually adds a line from Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upa -4-3-32</p>
<p><strong>एतस्यैवानन्दस्यान्यानि भूतानि मात्राम् उपजीवन्ति ॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ētasya-ēva-ānandasya-anyāni bhūtāni mātrām upa-jīvanti.</strong></p>
<p>Tom, Dick and Harry or anyone in this world, can experience this ānanda which is the pure expansive state and a state of utter nothingness. One is touching that no mind state and is getting the feel of joy. Every experience of happiness is a state where mind for a moment has become empty-rid of its problems, rid of its anxieties, cares and worries. Can sukha be this simple? I fought with the truths of Upaniṣads for two years. That was my struggle. That was my research. Can it be this simple? But every time I tried an experiment using some bhogavastu, sukhānubhava is very much felt by me. I am confident in saying that every one of you will get this experience also. Śāstra puts this as amanībhāva. Gowḍapāda in his kārika (Māṇ.Up.3, Ka.32) of Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad has this beautiful thing to say:</p>
<p><strong>आत्मसत्यानुबोधेन न सङ्कल्पयते यदा।</strong></p>
<p><strong>अमनस्तां तदा याति ग्राह्याभावे तदग्रहम्॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ātma-satya-anubōdhēna na saṅkalpayatē yadā,</strong></p>
<p><strong>amanastāṁ tadā yāti grāhya-abhāvē tat-agraham.</strong></p>
<p>While modifications of mind stop having realised Self, no mind state is attained due to the absence of graspable phenomenal world.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of realizing yourself?&ndash;you have to touch that no-thought state.-you get into that no-mind state. A no-mind state is verily brahma. The śloka from Kaṭha Upaniṣad (2-6-10) is proclaiming this very same truth.</p>
<p><strong>यदा पञ्चावतिष्ठन्ते ज्ञानानि मनसा सह ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>बुद्धिश्च न विचेश्टते तामाहुः परमां गतिम्॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yadā pañca-avatiṣṭhantē jñānāni manasā saha,</strong></p>
<p><strong>buddhiḥ-ca na vicēśṭatē tāmāhuḥ paramāṁ gatim.</strong></p>
<p>When the five sense organs are not functioning, when the mind is not functioning, when even the buddhi is not functioning, that is your holy state. That is your exalted state. That is your true nature. That is your blissful state. The terminal śloka of that Nārada Sanatkumāra ākhyāyika (Chāndogya Upa 7-24) says-</p>
<p><strong>यत्र नान्यत्पश्यति नान्यच्छृणोति नान्यद्विजानाति स भूमा॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yatra na-anyat-paśyati na-anyat-śr̥ṇōti na- anyat-vijānāti sa bhūmā.</strong></p>
<p>When you do not perceive anything, when you are not hearing anything, when you are not in the knowledge of anything that is your expansive state. The meaning of the word Bhūma is that of vyāpakatva- a state of expansion.</p>
<p><strong>यो वै भूमा तत्सुखं नाल्पे सुखमस्ति भूमा वै सुखम्॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yo vai bhūmā tat-sukhaṃ na-alpe sukham-asti bhūmā vai sukham.</strong> (Chāndogya Upa 7-23)</p>
<p>Bhūma state is really the blessed state, the blissful state as against the confined state which is not blissful and profound. Man considers that watching details is the right action. Actually it is ‘alpatva swīkāra’- that is, a constricted state of mind. All the research work that we are into is the work of scrutiny which is a toiling phase. Indriya vyāpāra means capturing details. Bhūma vai sukham- <strong>that let-go state is sukha</strong>. Vedānta is not brainwashing you.</p>
<p><strong>नापूर्वं वक्षति श्रुतिः</strong>। <strong>Na-pūrvaṁ vakṣati śrutiḥ.</strong></p>
<p>Śruti doesn’t tell you anything that is not within the zone of your experience.</p>
<p><strong>ज्ञापकमात्रम् हि शास्त्रम्</strong>- <strong>Jñāpaka-mātram hi śāstram -</strong>- Śāstra is but a reminder of whatever you know. Every experience of sukha, is verily a mind in broken state—a decomposed mind&mdash;a non functioning mind. In fact, the thought formation forces cannot connect themselves into a thought. What a realization! You see that every joy is an empty state of mind-an expansive state of mind- an <strong>advaitasthiti- अद्वैतस्थिति.</strong></p>
<p>Even sukha, on examination, reduces itself to a no-mind state. If the frequency moments of sukha are increased very much, you are just nonexistent and the shell is terribly expanded for a moment. This is the same as the state of vistārata described as a remedy to Duḥkha. There is a gradation in Duḥkha state -continuous duḥkha – ati-duḥkha - somewhat duḥkha - very slight duḥkha - the curve reaches a no mind state - you cannot even think further. A further inference of this one, a bigger version of this process, makes one to conclude that, sukha and duḥkha, being separate entities, are interconnected. They are very much like conductivity and resistance. Reciprocal of resistance is conductivity. Reciprocal of conductivity is resistance. Less and less of duḥkha is more and more of sukha. Thus there are only two aspects of Duḥkha-</p>
<p>One is the Speed, at thinking centre or cittasthāna (mind centre – Ājñācakra – space between the eye brows). The other is the focussing-which is constant minding, resulting in one pointedness and this is termed as sankocata. This is also termed as a coning phase. In order to overcome these two aspects of duḥkha:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace speed or Vega by slowness or Naidhānya at the mental level.</li>
<li>Replace Sankocata or focussing by diffusion. This is the let go attitude or udāsīna bhāva</li>
</ol>
<p>Sukha is:</p>
<p>Mind or cittasthāna becomes empty in the moments of happiness derived through agencies. A no mind state is created for a fraction of a moment. Consciously hold on to the no mind state so generated and try to stay there as long as possible, abandoning the agency that gave you the state. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (5-9-43) declares -</p>
<p><strong>दृश्यदर्शनसम्बन्धे सुखसंविदनुत्तम।</strong></p>
<p><strong>दृश्य संवलिता बन्धस्तन्मुक्ता मुक्तिरुच्यते॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr̥śya-darśana-sambandhē sukha-saṁvit- anuttama,</strong></p>
<p><strong>dr̥śya saṁvalitā bandhaḥ-tan-muktā muktiḥ- ucyatē.</strong></p>
<p>Born is the happiness when the seer and the seen are in contact. But, it is still bondage when the seer is attached to the seen and it is freedom when detached from it.</p>
<p>I will take up questions from you to sort out any doubts on whatever we discussed till now.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>Does not a material sukha, what you explained now, leads to hankering for more bhoga?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, but we get a glimpse of that śāṣvata sukha in this bhogasukha. Therefore one has to see this welcome element and stay firm in it and then reject the hankering for bhoga.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>Does the peace of mind, as described above relate to viṣayasukha?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> This is another good objection on sukha. But it is that peace of mind that is referred to as sukha in the tradition also. Again the two questions overlap. Actually in our viṣayasukha moment, the penultimate positions are in excitement whereas the real point is in peace. We are tempted to say that this excitement is a sukha element. The penultimate centres are in excited state and therefore one is tempted to conclude sukha carries the element of excitement which is the previous position or the taditarasthāna. The after position or the samīpasthāna is the peaceful expansive state. When we discuss the mechanism of sukha in the next lecture, we will discuss the things involved in the mechanism of bhogasukha and then clarity would come to all of you.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>If we slow down our activity, it will certainly be good, but in the eyes of the people that would look very odd and embarrassing?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> All those things have to be managed of course. When you slow down your activity, it has an effect on the whole system. The system becomes so relaxed that it becomes impossible to do any work at one point of time. One simply wants to spend time in silence. Slowness becomes a point of comfort when these rules are applied. When one centre in the body slows down, every other centre takes the suggestion and slows down.</p>
<p>The other point is this attention business. It is here that a student finds difficulty. He likes to be focussing all the time as it improves the performance. But the truth is otherwise. One may perform better, but one has to pay the price for that effort, which ultimately works on the system itself. Truths cannot change themselves to one’s convenience. The fact is that if one holds on to concentration for a longer time, the system complains. This conclusion doesn’t go well with modern ideas of performance and production. That is what one has to manage. One can&rsquo;t fight against the truth. If the truth is questionable then it is fine. Otherwise the argument does not stand.</p>
<p>I remember one instance when I had to undergo a minor operation. I was waiting in the preparation room and the thing got delayed as the surgeon was very busy performing another major operation. He was a doctor of repute and he had the habit of going through every detail to make sure that things went on well and there should be no cause for failure. This put him under serious focussing. When he came out of the theatre I could see him puff and crash into the sofa and leave a very big sigh of relief. Why did he do that? The body system was saying that he needed rest very badly. That was a very good observation for me and that was a very good case where I could certify the truths of the Upaniṣad-s. Why does one shift from a serious mood to a lighter mood? Why does one get to an act of sipping a cup of coffee after a hard working day? Why does one say that he needs relaxation? The fact shows that serious mood is a state of <strong>suffering</strong>. Lighter mood is a state of contentment or **tṛpti_. _**That’s a proof.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Don’t you think we have to do a balancing act because at certain point we have to continue our lives?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Fine. That is the compromise. Right, but we should appreciate the point that it is necessary to take a break.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> But that does not mean I stop concentrating. I may be taking a break but I am still in that mood? We cannot stop our attention mood as it is very important in life?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> No. The śāstra is examining facts and their nature. That’s the point. How much of śāstra you will use for your life is another question. That’s a matter of necessity. That’s a matter of the situation or the profession in which you are placed. I am not advising everyone to give up focussing or speed. But one very important point you must remember here is, that when I am talking of speed<strong>it is not the physical speed. It is the internal speed. The speed of the mind within is thousand times faster than the speed at the physical level.</strong> One has to keep this always in mind when we talk of reducing speed.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Is it possible to drop speed when you are focussing?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, I will add a little more. I told you about that doctor&rsquo;s plight, because that’s a more serious question. Most of the times we tend to seek adjustments, compromise, taking approximate positions. So, whenever focussing is a must, you tag on slowness to it. If you are slow, focussing is acceptable for the system. Slowness can decrease the evil effects of focussing. Any amount of focussing is sustainable when the other element is taken care of, namely slowness. Once you go with the study yourselves, many more truths come out. That’s why everybody would be a teacher on his own once he starts looking inside. That leisureliness will enlarge the shell. Every time you are in the leisurely mood, or the let-go mood, you are an enlarged shell. You are a big sphere. In that sphere if you focus, you are doing that peripherally. We use the word for that, peripheral focussing, and casual focussing. It is a fact. The śāstra uses a very big word to refer to this: udāsīnabhāva, <strong>उदासीनभाव</strong>, anāsaktibhāva, <strong>अनासक्तिभाव</strong>, sākṣībhāva-<strong>सक्षीभाव.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Can focussing be possible when you are in diffused state?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> It is possible. They can co exist. The two can stay concurrently. People say that Vedānta takes one away from one’s profession. It proves again and again that worldly and mundane pursuits do not become hurdles for sukha. Therefore you don’t have to become an ascetic or other worldly. It is a paradox. Defocused focussing means bulk of you, mentally, is positioned in a happy way. A part of you is involved in that mundane process. That is how every jñāni manages. Lord Kṛṣṇa would be most efficient-but very casual, but at the same time very careful in details. So a jñāni need not walk away from life. If he chooses to walk away like Ramaṇa, it is okay, like Rāmakṛṣṇa, it is okay. Performance-wise one can excel the other man who does not know these secrets.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> If one gets into such a grove of slowing down, will it not affect the overall performance of the person?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> This is exactly the reaction of every group that I meet with. Will the whole technology drop down if every man slows down? Everybody is unnecessarily rubbing too much on the wrong side. Why don’t you live with nature? Environment is safe when you don’t peck and interfere. Really speaking, this is the highest point. We understand that during the days of Kṛutayuga people were so much satisfied that they did not even bother to build a hut for them to live in. What is wrong if that fellow is as happy as the modern man with all this technology around him? We must be able to give this point to the advocates of technology. A fellow who is sitting under the tree is equally happy doing nothing. Then how is he inferior? Point out one defect about that. <strong>Bhartṛhari</strong> in his **Vairāgya Śataka-**वैराग्यशतक (53) -quotes-</p>
<p><strong>वयमिह परितुष्टा वल्कलैस्त्वं दुकूलैः।</strong></p>
<p><strong>सम इह परितोषो निर्विशेषो विशेषः</strong>॥</p>
<p><strong>Vayam-iha parituṣṭā valkalaiḥ-tvaṁ dukūlaiḥ,</strong></p>
<p><strong>sama iha paritōṣō nirviśēṣō viśēṣaḥ.</strong></p>
<p>A sage comes across a king and develops a conversation. Oh King, you are with your silken garments and I am with my bark garments. If the happiness you have is because of the silk and the happiness I have is because of this crude cloth, how are you superior to me?</p>
<p>What logic! How are you superior to me if both of us are equally happy, you with all your comforts and I with no comforts?</p>
<p><strong>स तु भवतु दरिद्रो यस्य तृष्णा विशाल। ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>मनसि च परितुष्टे कोऽर्थवान् को दरिद्रः</strong> ॥</p>
<p><strong>Sa tu bhavatu daridrō yasya tr̥ṣṇā viśāla,</strong></p>
<p><strong>manasi ca parituṣṭē kō-arthavān kō daridraḥ</strong>.</p>
<p>When the mind is self satisfied how to differentiate a rich man from a poor one? This is the challenge the Indian wise men always had on positions of importance. It is not abhāva-vairāgya.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> I don’t think that the issue is with the internal happiness vis a vis technology. It should somehow be possible to bridge both. Take the case of Arjuna, who did not want to fight before he heard the message from Kṛṣṇa, afterwards he fought. On the one hand he is peaceful internally and at the same time he has a duty to perform. This is where the problem arises. What is your opinion about this?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> You have to be careful while you apply this knowledge to the society in general. Therefore if the society is different, don’t disturb the society, allow it to have mixed levels. Society must have the benefit of development of technology. A hypothetical question would be as to what happens to civilisation if technology is completely dropped. When everyone is happy with minimum needs, what’s wrong with that one? I wish such a world comes into existence. That was the message of Kṛṣṇa. Of course much discussion has to take place. And another reason why Arjuna was coaxed into karma by Kṛṣṇa was that he was still not fit for taking up a life of a mendicant.</p>
<p>Theoretically one may understand this, but one may not be fit for total vairāgya. At the conceptual level we may appreciate. You can’t deny yourself the study, pursuits, achievements and all that. System transformation doesn’t take place simultaneously with your understanding of concepts. There is a time lag. There is a phase difference. We must wait. Only one person who could succeed totally and suddenly drop activities of the world was Ramaṇa Maharṣi. He realized this point. People made these objections on him and he just laughed at them. Some people choose the vedāntic way of living while others are willing to focus and carry on with work keeping their balance of mind for the benefit of humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Arjuna, after he listened to Sri Kṛṣṇa initially was willing to lay down his arms and keep quiet. But the Lord would not allow him. Why?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Arjuna appreciated the sānkhya ideas, just as we are now appreciating the logic of Vedānta to be true and correct. He appreciated the truths of Vedānta and then he said he would surrender and keep quiet. But Kṛṣṇa knew that Arjuna’s body-mind system was not prepared for that. Simply understanding the truths of the Upaniṣads is not sufficient. The forces within, bhoga-utsāha, karma-utsāha are still operating. I will come to that point when we do ātmāparīkṣa. Therefore his advice to Arjuna was to do karma and expend the unbearable energy.</p>
<p>We know that keeping quiet is the ultimate answer for happiness. But, structurally we are not prepared for that. That is where the idea of karmayoga comes. Karma sanyāsa is recommended as the ultimate position. The next step of compromise or adjustment is karmayoga because we cannot keep quiet. The whole of third and fourth chapters in Bhagavad-Ġīta (3-1) deal with the subject of karma yoga versus karma sanyāsa. Arjuna puts this very question—</p>
<p><strong>ज्यायसी चेत् कर्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिर्जनार्दन।</strong></p>
<p><strong>तत्किं कर्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि केशव॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jyāyasī cēt karmaṇḥ-tē matā buddhiḥ-janārdana,</strong></p>
<p><strong>tat-kiṁ karmaṇi ghōrē māṁ niyōjayasi kēśava.</strong></p>
<p>He asks Kṛṣṇa, ‘Why are you forcing me to the war which is very bad although you know well that knowledge is superior to action?’ He has appreciated this discussion and says that Kṛṣṇa has proved that keeping quiet is all joy. The answer is - Arjuna is not fit for keeping quiet yet.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: There comes the question of &rsquo;expectation&rsquo;. How do you explain the removal of expectation of returns from action?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The other point where Vedānta makes a mark is to let that person examine whether he can be happy without doing. Most of us cannot remain so, though logically that position is correct. Even I cannot do that. Why? There is the boredom force acting within, which is driving one to activity. I will come to that in the next lecture when we do ātmaparīkṣa. The reason for anyone who says that he is doing work for so many good causes is that he cannot keep quiet. The proof for this is very simple. If I challenge you to sit quiet for ten minutes without doing anything, you may say that it is very easy. But if I ask you to remain quiet for half an hour, then you fail the test. Why?</p>
<p>Vedānta gives an answer to that point in the <strong>yogaśāstra- योगशास्त्र</strong>. There is what is called a life force, a vital force or <strong>kundaliniśakti- कुण्डलिनीशक्ति</strong>, if you care to use a technical word. It is there at the <strong>mūlādhāra- मूलाधार</strong> and is continuously releasing <strong>sūkṣmaśakti- सूक्ष्मशक्ति</strong> or<strong>prāṇaśakti</strong> into the system, to every part of the body. It flows up into the <strong>ūrdhvasthāna- ऊर्ध्वस्थान</strong>and comes to <strong>ājñācakrasthāna- आज्ञाचक्रस्थान</strong>, where pressure is built up. If the rates at which it is produced and expended are not equal, then you develop a pressure. And the pressure so developed drives you into activity. This is the most reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>The proof is very simple. Sit in the house without any work. That is the biggest test, to check whether you are growing in the vedāntic way or not. No wife to talk to. No kitchen where you can go and get some salted cashew nut or anything of that kind. No tape recorder to play music. Sit and try. Try this simple experiment. Everybody in the world fails. Why?</p>
<p>This is the explanation. Continuously energy is being released. Fortunately for man, as quickly as it is released he is expending it. The child cries away its energy. The fool talks away his energy. Man walks away his energy. A clever man thinks away his energy and therefore each one is comfortable. The subtlest burden is the pressure of boredom forces. He is spending this blocked up energy in ever so many ways that the system gets used to it and therefore he is comfortable where as he gives credit to karma, saying that Karma gave him joy. Spending of the energy is the only means by which one is becoming empty at the Ājñācakra. This mechanism is giving him joy and not karma as such.</p>
<p>This is the way we are all happy. Karma is a means of expenditure of this unbearable energy. Once that is spent away we are in the non-doing phase at the ājñācakra. We become empty, that is, we reach the no-mind state called amanībhāva. No activity-state is the point of joy, is the content of joy. This mechanism is giving him joy and not karma as such.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Does it divert the energy?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, incidentally this question is to be answered. If intake of coffee or any other bhogavastu leads to bhogasukha, then why don’t we have more and more of coffee or more and more of bhoga? The answer lies here. Although bhogasukha works by this mechanism, it has a defect as this drifting of the energy, shifting of the energy to the indriyasthāna is only temporary. Every indriya has a limit point. This skill to draw the energy has its limitation. The first sweet is enjoyable, the second sweet is acceptable and the third sweet is repulsive. Even at the cost of annoying the host you say, ‘sorry I cannot take it’, Why? The tongue fails to draw the energy. At that point, the energy goes back into its original place, into its swasthāna and again you are restless. That is the reason why we call the bhogasukha as short lived. When the energy expenditure mechanism to overcome the boredom is overdone, it results in restlessness again. Preceded by a disturbed state, succeeded by a disturbed state and for a small interval of time in-between, the mind quietens. Hence, bhogasukha is short lived.</p>
<p><u>If you can reduce the creation of energy itself or its release by s</u>ā<u>dhana then the dependence on Bhoga gets dropped and you are in lasting happiness.</u> Then, you can naturally expand your shell. In a small sphere, the amount of thrust or the impulse on the unit area is more. Suppose the sphere is very big, the same thrust or impulse on a much bigger sphere is much smaller. Distributed over a larger area, you don’t feel the burden at all. So, if you apply the rule of naidhānya or apply the principle of vistārata, then the boredom forces are automatically absorbed or dissolved away and you don’t complain. This is a permanent method to be happy. So, a vedāntin is not running away from bhoga for ascetic reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> I appreciate your point very much that parīkṣa of Duḥkha is necessary to come out of it, but why one should do parīkṣa of sukha as it is a glorified state already?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> This parīkṣa is required because we are always experiencing this ānanda. Humans are in continuous touch with the svarūpa, but does not take notice of that one. This is the unfortunate situation of man. He doesn’t know that svarūpasthiti is ānanda. To remove this ignorance, serious study is required. That’s all. The role of bhoga in the experiment is only incidental. Laddoo or the sweet dish or coffee did not carry the principle of ānanda. It is incidental that Laddoo brought about an expansive state inside, an empty state inside. The point of importance is this one. After understanding this point, our attention should get shifted. Our value system should be revised. Bhogavastu has a marginal role. This has necessitated the sādhana actually. Should you struggle for ānanda? The clever sādhaka on the other hand uses the bhoghavastu as a means to get the glimpse of brahmasukha, drops bhogavastu and holds on to the sukha only.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>Is puruşārtha not necessary-then?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. That’s the trouble with all the people. People have mystified the whole thing. I can give you hundreds of stanzas to show that this is the ultimate. It is very clear in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa—</p>
<p><strong>यन्मनो विलयं याति तद्विष्णोः परमं पदम्</strong>।</p>
<p><strong>Yanmanō vilayaṁ yāti tat-viṣṇōḥ paramaṁ padam.</strong></p>
<p>What is viṣṇupada - vaikuṇṭa? Yatra manaḥ vilayaṁ yāti -where mind gets extinguished that is svarūpa. That is puruśārtha. That is mokṣa. This stanza, Yatra manaḥ vilayaṁ yāti tadviṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ.—does not refer to the vaikuṇṭa with seven doors, Jaya and Vijaya keeping guard of that one etc. Yatra manaḥ -where mind is absent, that is vaikuṇṭa.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> When thought is formed in the mind, there is no differentiation whether it is thought for happiness or otherwise. Then where is the thoughtless mind?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. What happens in the bhogasukha is that there is an excitement co existing with peace. Therefore we are tempted to say that happiness is that excitement. Really speaking, there are two overlapping parameters. If you disassociate them, the real point of contribution, which is the ‘peace element’, comes to the fore. I will dwell on the topic of how Bhogasukha brings about peace in my next lecture.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong> Śankara says that bhogasukha gives a glimpse of brahmānanda. Don’t you think bhoga is excitement and where is ānanda there?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Content wise they are identical. The doṣa about bhogasukha is, that it is short lived. With the withdrawal of bhoga, again you come back to the objective world of seeking. That’s the doṣa. This point I will take up in detail in the next lecture-the mechanism involved in bhogasukha, what is the erroneous element and how to make a correction of that.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
