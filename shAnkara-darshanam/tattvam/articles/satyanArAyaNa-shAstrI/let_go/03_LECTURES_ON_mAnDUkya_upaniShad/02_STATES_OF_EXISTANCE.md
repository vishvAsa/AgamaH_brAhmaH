title = "02 STATES OF EXISTANCE"

+++

We will discuss now as to what clue a sādhaka gets from the study of the different states of existence of man as enumerated in Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad.The first state is- (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 3)

**जागरितस्थानः बहिष्प्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः स्थूलभुग्वैश्वानरः प्रथमः पादः॥**

**Jāgarita-sthānaḥ bahiḥ-prajñaḥ saptāṅga ēkōnaviṁśati-mukhaḥ sthūla-bhuk vaiśvānaraḥ prathamaḥ pādaḥ.**

(The waking state outwardly conscious, having seven limbs and nineteen doors, enjoying gross objects common to all, is the first State.)

You are in a capacity of cognizing the world outside of you. Bahiṣprajñaḥ–your cognising capacity is outward. Then – saptāńgaḥ –You are seven limbed. Ekonavimśati mukhaḥ –You have one less than twenty that is nineteen faces. These are the ventilators or the outlets by which you contact the outside world.

They are five karmendriyā-s -five senses or indriyā-s of excreting, procreating, moving, grasping, and speaking,

Five Jnānendriyā-s -the five cognitive senses of smelling, tasting, seeing, touching, and hearing- Pañca prāṇā-s - five prāṇas -prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, udāna, and samāna.

Four functions of mind or aspects of antaḥkaraṇa, the inner instrument-- which are manas, buddhi, citta and ahaṁkāra.

Through these outlets man touches the outside world and relates them. This is one aspect of ‘me’ or one version of ‘me' or one pāda of ‘me’. After perceiving he enjoys. Likes and dislikes begin to operate. He begins to choose good and bad (priya-apriya – sukha-duḥkha) with his capacity to perceive the outside world, capacity to enjoy and capacity to do (Jñātṛtva-Bhoktṛtva-Kartṛtva). This is my jāgṛtāvastha. What a beautiful condensation of details! Hundreds and thousands of my activities are brought under one term- jāgaritasthāna. This fellow in the jāgṛt-avastha is called **Vaiśvānara**. He is sthūlabhuk- he is enjoying the gross world, its likes and dislikes, sukha and duḥkha etc.

Just as there is an outside world, there is an inside world which is our second state - (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 4)

**स्वप्नस्थानोऽन्तःप्रज्ञः सप्ताङ्ग एकोनविंशतिमुखः प्रविविक्तभुक्तैजसो द्वितीयः पादः।**

**Svapna-sthānaḥ antaḥ-prajñaḥ saptāṅga ēkōnaviṁśati-mukhaḥ pravivikta-bhuk taijasaḥ dvitīyaḥ pādaḥ.**

(The dream state, inwardly conscious, having seven limbs and nineteen doors, enjoying subtle objects that are luminous, is the second version of me or pāda of me.)

It is called svapna-sthāna--is similar to jāgaritasthāna -is a duplication of the first state with a difference that the world you are connecting is not the outside world but the inside world. It has the same three capacities, jñātṛtva, kaṛtutva, bhoktṛtva- but the world is inside – svapna-prapañca. The vāsanā-s of jāgṛt are imprinted in the memory centres and shows up in dream with all the details and all the intricacies- the dreaming of a serpent is so real that the dreamer shudders and shouts only to find out that it is false.

He is called **taijasaḥ**- the world that he is transacting is tejomātra. Everything is optical or ethereal. How do you distinguish the inside world from the outside world? To me, the objects in jāgṛt have a mass, but there is no mass in dream world. One can lift a mountain or even fight with a demon which is impossible in jāgṛt. Otherwise that world is as much a world as the one in which we are all there, in terms of details like sounds and pictures. In svapna he is pravivktabhuk- the enjoyment he has is of the subtle inside world.

**Q**. There seems to be no recording in svapna where as in jagṛt there is a definite imprint on the mind. Can you elaborate on this?

**A**. The possible explanation is- this jāgṛt phase is different from svapnasthāna wherein every day, the dream content is different. No two dreams are identical whereas jāgṛt does not change. In jāgṛt, there is some law operating whereas, within the dream there is no consistent law operating. There is no consistent event taking place and changes are so rapid that there is no relation between two events. Although the time scales are different between the jāgṛt and the dream phase, there is no law operating in the dream.

The laws in jagṛt are intact and are applicable to everyone and there is no dispute here, where as the laws in dream varies from person to person. It cannot be argued that the jāgṛt is different every day by the simple logic that if one keeps a material on the table, the previous night before going to sleep; the material will be in the same place when he wakes up the next day. The details are intact between today’s and tomorrow’s jāgṛt. In a dream there is no connection between two dreams. So, jāgṛt has a more steady and enduring quality than the dream state.

The argument that one has created this outside world is easily defeated by the point that the laws have not changed and the individual is not capable of changing them. So this world is not created by ‘me’. Similarly the dream world also cannot be manipulated. Actually my own position is that the spandanā-s released in the cosmos collect themselves into a pattern and give us a dream, but the world of imagination is in our hands.

Now we can distinguish between two worlds. The world of dreams which is ethereal and over which we have no control. Whereas in the jāgṛt, it is possible to imagine what we need and also reject what we do not want. This is actually the inside world with ‘me’ as the creator. We cannot say that we are creating many unpleasant things and are suffering as no one would create things for suffering. We have no volition in the dream since dream is throwing images helplessly from the memory centre. The point of importance is that the real jagat (as a dream) has a mass and dream jagat has no mass. Therefore this world or the inside world is created by something called ‘ātmā’ or the mind.

An all pervading consciousness principle has created the visible world. This world being the world of imagination, can also be created by a consciousness is the pre vedāntic position. Whether it is Īśvarā’s or my consciousness is debatable. One thing is certain that the world is not a creation of my consciousness because I cannot make a thing desired by me. I should be able to make and unmake things. So I cannot agree that this world is my projection.

I can however agree that another consciousness in the capacity of Īśvara has projected this world and I am vibrating in resonance. That is possible. If I insist on my world of imagination and if it is very strong then the pictures can stay longer. Paatanjalividyā says that.

Svapnasthāna is a phase where you show that you are the projector of the universe. One may argue that jāgṛt is created by someone else, but the proof is in the dream world. We call svapna unreal because it is not possible for us to hold a picture or sound for a longer time. Our minds are fickle-there is such a cāncalya that it is impossible to hold a picture of even our iṣṭadevata.

If one could hold the picture of say ’Kālimāta’ like Sri Rāmakṛṣṇa, which was so real to him then the matter is very much different. He had such a conviction that he answered Vivekānanda in affirmation that he has seen God just as he is seeing Vivekānanda. He further said that he could show him God if Vivekānanda was so interested. Nobody in the world has made such a daring statement till today. That was his capacity to create any object. So it is the question of dhārana. Still, it could be ethereal and that is the whole message of Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha.

**दृष्टासु अस्यमात्रेण देहः अदेहतां याति ।**

**Dr̥ṣṭāsu asya-mātrēṇa dēhaḥ a-dēhatāṁ yāti.**

A point comes where he says that body does not exist and is only an imagination. If you emphasise that view, the body vanishes- it is terrible to imagine! If your imagination is so strong and insisting, then adeha becomes deha.

**Yōga saṁsiddhi saṁvidām  - योग** संसिद्धि **संविदाम्।**For those who are experts in yoga - **sulabhēyam –सुलभेयम्** - it is very easy- says Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha. The consciousness that can divide and hold on the object of imagination is called **citta-vicchēda** - **चित्तविछेद.** This aspect was called **prāṇa-pratiṣṭa** - **प्राणप्रतिष्ठ**. It is a surprise to all of us.

The Svapna is not important for our sukha-duḥkha study, but it is to understand whether we can get a clue for the creation. Does the Indian position about creation have any meaning to the modern world or the modern scientist? Science has begun to recognise the role of Consciousness in the creation of Universe. Can we subscribe to that or is the position too weak for want of sufficient data? The dream world which is as intricate as the one we experience is created by the consciousness. Therefore we are tempted to suspect that this intricate world with all the energy-mass has been created likewise. Can we conclude that way and if so, are we reasonable or not, should be the scientific study. Otherwise there is no importance to svapna phase discussion which we did till now.

But Vedānta takes a different view. Can we ever say as to what the dream fellow experiences is unreal? We never have an impression that we are passing through the dream phase while dreaming. We say that, only when we wake up. Gauḍapāda takes up this question and devotes a whole chapter called Vaitathya Prakaraṇa. It is very difficult to understand that prakaraṇa. We should only wonder and keep quiet when things come to our mind about creation.

Now we will go to the next important state.( Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad 5)

**यत्र सुप्तो न कञ्चन कामं कामयते न कञ्चन स्वप्नं पश्यति तत्सुषुप्तम् । सुषुप्तस्थान एकीभूतः प्रज्ञानघन एवानन्दमयो ह्यान्दभुक्चेतोमुखः प्राज्ञस्तृतीयः पादः॥**

**Yatra suptō na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati tat suṣuptam.**

**Suṣuptasthāna ēkībhūtaḥ prajñānaghana ēva- ānandamayō hi-ānanda-bhuk-cētō-mukhaḥ prājñaḥ tr̥tīyaḥ pādaḥ.**

We are thinking of the third phase of human existence, the first two being the waking state and the dream state. Sleep is now defined. I wonder at the excellent definition which even the present day psychologists are unable to condense into such form.

**Na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē** -no emotions what so ever- kāma is rāga, dveṣa and bhaya - attraction, repulsion and fear - inferiority complex, irritability, violent emotions

**Na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati -** emotional components of the mind are absent and thinking component of the mind is also absent. Svapna includes the jāgṛt perception also.

**Tat suṣuptam -** excellent definition for characterising nidrā. You have a dreamless sleep. Thinking and emotional aspects are absent.

The teacher says that you are neither in waking nor in dream state, where dwaitabodha or duality is not there. There is a knower and a world that is known in the other two states- a cognisor and the cognized. This is absent in nidrā. We glorified the waking state saying that all that was in it is essential part of us. Although he is spending half of his time in nidrā, he is underscoring the same without giving it any importance. If one can appreciate this, his anxiety will go. This shows our priorities are wrongly taken. A precise definition for Nidrā is called prājñāsthiti or suṣuptasthiti. Vaishvānara or jāgṛt, taijasa or svapna, prājña or suśupti are the three pādā-s or attributes to man. We have to understand the contents of nidrā and adopt it in the jāgṛt phase.Śankara clarifies why this happiness is due to (Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad-5, Śankarabhāṣya-16).

**अत्यन्तानायासरूपा हि इयं स्थितिः अनेन अनुभूयते इति आनन्दभुक्।**

**Atyanta-anāyāsa-rūpā hi iyaṁ sthitiḥ anēna**

**anubhūyatē iti ānanda-bhuk.**

Any sukha is āyāsa-rāhitya. What is the āyāsa that was found in jagrat and svapna and which is absent in nidrā?

**मनसः विषय विषय्याकारस्पन्दनायासदुःखाभावात् आनन्दमयः।**

**Manasaḥ viṣaya viṣayi-ākāra-spandana-āyāsa duḥkha-abhāvāt ānanda-mayaḥ.**

You are continuously oscillating between two pulsations - thinking and emotions which are the taxing elements.

**तत् रहितत्वात् आनन्दभुक् - tat rahitatvāt ānandabhuk -**the absence of these two gives ānanda. 

**दर्शन स्मरणे ऎव हि मन: स्पन्दिते -  darśana smaraṇē eva hi manaḥ spanditē**- Mind reacts only to the experiences of senses as well as memory.

**तदभावे हृद्येव अविशेषेण प्राणात्मना अवस्थानम् ।**

**Tat-abhāvē hr̥di-ēva aviśēṣēṇa prāṇa-ātmanā avasthānam -**In the absence of it you are mere spandana of prāṇa.

We should never lose sight of the main issue of our study which is to **give us clarity about what should man do in the name of coming out of duḥkha and attaining permanent happiness.** We should search for situations where we are permanently happy.

In jāgṛt it is a divided happiness, broken as it were. Such a thing is not there in nidrā. One could pose a naughty question as to why he should study the nidrā phase in man! The lesson is, that it is the happiest state by anybody’s admission and is not because of any religious brainwashing. Every one, whether he is cultured or not says that nidrā is the happiest state. Man would forego anything in preference to sleep.

For the pursuit of happiness what are the characteristics we have to adopt?

**Na kañcana kāmaṁ kāmayatē na kañcana svapnaṁ paśyati.**The hint here is very clear. These were the two elements of burden both in Jāgṛt and Svapna. Kāma is an agitated state or fastness. A scientific thinker can put all the factors like kāma, krodha, mada, mātsarya, lobha and moha condensed into one term—as **vega**-force or **speed** inside us. Physical speed is nothing compared to mental speed. We can say that there is a volcano inside. We don’t have to conquer the forces inside one by one, but we can control only the mental speed and with the result, the other untamed forces also reduce slowly.

The teacher says that one cannot under-rate the sleep phase. Why?

Ānandabhuk, ānandmayaḥ- the whole study is here. Here is a clue for eliminating duḥkha. You are enjoying ānanda in nidrā, whereas you are enjoying the outside world in jāgṛt, which is a combination of sukha and duḥkha. You are happiness itself in nidrā. Here is a method by which one can always be happy.

What is the method by which one can always be happy? Whatever are the constituents of sleep must be responsible for happiness. If you want happiness, do not create disturbing emotions and thoughts**. Staying in wakeful state incorporating the characteristics of nidrā is the solution for lasting happiness**. That is all Vedānta. Everyone in the world does not miss sleep. They even go the extent of taking a sleeping pill for that purpose.

Sleep is alright in one way, but is not all, as some forces trap or trip you to sleep and you are helpless. If one wants to be in a state of ānanda, all the characteristics of nidrā has to be introduced voluntarily in the jāgṛt state. This state is called jāgṛn-nidrā or ajādya-nidrā.

**प्रत्यङ्विबोधैक बलेन पुंसां।**

**प्राचीन गन्धेषु पलायितेषु ।**

**प्रादुर्भवेत् काचित् अजाड्य निद्रा ।**

**प्रपञ्चचिन्तां परिमार्जयन्ति॥**

**Pratyaṅvibōdhaika balēna puṁsāṁ,**

**prācīna gandhēṣu palāyitēṣu,**

**prādurbhavēt kācit ajāḍya nidrā,**

**prapañca-cintāṁ parimārjayanti.**

On the strength of realisation of Self a person retreats from tendencies gathered over several lives. Then, dawns a state similar to slumber sans its impurity by the result of which all the worldly sorrows get completely extinguished.

An excellent śloka. Through this analysis and this parīkṣa you can know where happiness lies. Happiness lies in the non-doing when all the Vāsanā-s are washed away by vicāra. You get the wakeful sleep or invited nidrā or calculated nidrā. Contemplation is necessary to accept this point.

Perform all the tasks of your wakeful state in a leisurely manner and incorporate the qualities of non-doing in doing, then doing becomes simple and effective. Bhagavad Gīta (4-8) asserts:

**कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः।**

**स बुद्धिमान् मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत्॥**

**Karmaṇi-akarma yaḥ paśyēt-akarmaṇi ca karma yaḥ,**

**sa buddhimān manuṣyēṣu sa yuktaḥ kr̥tsnakarmakr̥t.**

He who sees action in inaction and inaction in action is a wise and strong man. He is a yogi and performer of all actions. Can we come to the conclusion that there is no vyāpāra in nidrā as compared to jāgṛt? As per śāstra it is not a state of a-vyāpāra, but vyāpāra exists in seed form. Seed version means something that is hidden. It is prāṇa vyāpāra. Prāṇa is the general activity whereas thinking and emotions are specialized activities. If there was no vyāpāra, it is not possible to come back from sleep. As opined in Śankarabhāşya 24 on Gauḍapāda Kārika-2

**निर्बीजतयैव चेत् सति लीनानाम् संपन्नानाम् सुषुप्त -प्रलययोः पुनरुत्थानानुपपत्तिः स्यात् । मुक्तानाम् पुनरुत्पत्ति प्रसङ्गः।	**

**Nirbījatayā-ēva cēt sati līnānām saṁpannānām suṣupta-pralayayōḥ punarutthāna anupapattiḥ syāt, muktānām punarutpatti prasaṅgaḥ.	**

To come back, you have to infer that there is a bījarūpa of vyāpāra, that is, the general activity of prāṇa. In jāgṛt a fatigue point is reached in two hours. Whereas in nidrā, it takes six hours to reach the fatigue point since there is a very feeble vyāpāra. In Samādhi, it takes much longer. In fact you are comfortable even after you return to Jāgṛt. It took a very long time for Prahlāda to come back from Samādhi -** mahatā tēna śabdēna vaiśṇava prāṇa janmanaḥ -  महता तेन शब्देन वैश्णव प्राण जन्मन:।** a very big śankhanāda (sound of a conch) had to be blown to wake him up from Samādhi.

The more relaxed you are, the more time it takes you to come to the activity phase. In the light of this how do you do sādhana? Reduce the thought speed and emotion speed if you want to perform. Leisureliness is not anti productive as per śāstra. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa (5-7-9) puts it beautifully-

**बहिरुन्मत्तताण्डवः अन्तःशीतलतयता समधिरिति कथ्यत**॥

**Bahiḥ-unmatta-tāṇḍavaḥ antaḥ śītalatayatā samadhiḥ-iti kathyata**.

Although outwardly he appears to be in a ecstatic drunken state he is extremely cool internally – that is the Samādhisthiti.

**निस्त्रैगुण्ये पथि विचरतां को विधिः को निषेधः।**

**Nistraiguṇyē pathi vicaratāṁ kō vidhiḥ kō niṣēdhaḥ.** (Śukāṣṭakam)

For people who are hovering in realised state which is right and which is wrong. Everything seems fine and good. This state is called Turīya (Māṇḍ. Upaniṣad -7)

**नान्तःप्रज्ञं, न बहिष्प्रज्ञं**, **नॊभयतःप्रज्ञं**, **न प्रज्ञानघनं**, **न प्रज्ञं**, **नाप्रज्ञं अदृश्यं**, **अव्यवहार्यं**, **अग्राह्यं**, **अलक्शणं**, **अचिन्त्यं**, **अव्यपदॆश्यं**, **ऎकात्मप्रत्ययसारं**, **प्रपञ्चोपशमं**, **शान्तं**, **शिवं**, **अद्वैतं**, **चतुर्थं मन्यन्तॆ**, **स आत्मा स विज्ञॆयः॥**

**Na-antaḥ-prajñaṁ, na bahiḥ-prajñaṁ**, **na- ubhayataḥ-prajñaṁ**, **na prajñāna-ghanaṁ**, **na prajñaṁ**, **nā-prajñaṁ adr̥śyaṁ**, **avyavahāryaṁ**, **agrāhyaṁ**, **alakśaṇaṁ**, **acintyaṁ**, **avyapadeśyaṁ**, **ekātmapratyayasāraṁ**, **prapañcōpaśamaṁ**, **śāntaṁ**, **śivaṁ**, **advaitaṁ**, **caturthaṁ manyante**, **sa ātmā sa vijñeyaḥ.**

**Na antaḥprajñaṁ, na bahiṣprajñaṁ** - Both the inside and outside world are ruled out.

**Na prajñaṁ nāprajñaṁ naprajñānaghanam**- Not even the mere activity version of you-not even the prāṇa svarūpa.

**Prapañca upaśamaṁ śāntaṁ śivaṁ advaitam**-You are so relaxed and non doing that you are peace itself-one need not be afraid ofthis state. There is no touch of duality.

**Caturthaṁ manyante**-Knowers of wisdom call this the fourth state- **sa ātmā sa ca vijñeyaḥ**- That has to be rediscovered by the sādhaka.

Śankara raises a point regarding the turīya state. When a fourth position is enunciated it means that it is- **स एष नेति नेत्यात्मा - Sa eśa neti netyātmā--**. There is no way of explaining this state except by negating vaiśvānara, taijasa or prājñā–This is a major hint for sādhaka. Śankara while commenting on various occasions infers that there is no positive definition for Brahma. According to him the best definition is—**Neti neti ityeva brahma grāhyam- नेति नेति इत्येव ब्रह्म ग्राह्यम्**. When the urge to search stops, you are in brahma. It cannot be perceived. It is not a result of cognition. One of the best śloka-s is from Kena Upaniṣad(1-6).

**यन्मनसा न मनुते एनाहुर्मनो मतम्।**

**तदेव ब्रह्म त्वं विद्धि नेदं यदिदमुपासते॥**

**Yan-manasā na manutē ēna-āhurmanō matam,**

**tat-ēva brahma tvaṁ viddhi nēdaṁ yadidam-upāsatē.**

That which has given the cognizing power for the mind is brahma. The śloka has a poetic grandeur. The prior state to prāṇa, the prior state to the seeing power, the prior state to the listening power, the prior state to the talking power, the prior state to the thinking power is Bhrahma.

**Q.** Why Turīya is not considered as nidrā?

**A.** You must see the abstractness to which the student is compelled to rise. Dvaitasya agrahaṇa- Non  experience of duality is common to both in the nidrā and turīya phase. Why don’t you stop at the nidrā phase? What is there to drop? Since the activity did not go completely in nidrā, it is still an incomplete state. In Man.Up.1- Ka.11 it is stated that-

**कार्यकारण बद्धौ ताविष्येते विश्वतैजसौ ।**

**प्राज्ञः कारणबद्धस्तु द्वौ तौ तुर्ये न सिध्यतः॥**

**Kārya-kāraṇa baddhau tāviṣyētē viśva-taijasau,**

**prājñaḥ kāraṇa-baddhastu dvau tau turyē na sidh‌yataḥ.**

The observer in jāgṛt and svapna are bound by two types of bandhanā-s- kārya-bandhana and kāraṇa-bandhana. Emotions, rāga and dveṣa are kārya-bhandana. Un-specified general pulsation (as in Nidrā) is kāraṇa-bandhana. They are entrapped by helplessness.

**Prājñaḥ kāraṇa baddhastu-**prājñā is burdened only by the kāraṇa- bandhana (un-specified general pulsations).

**Dvau tau turye na sidhyataḥ** - Turīya is different this way that it is neither bound by kāraṇa-avidyā nor kārya-avidyā. Further, in Māṇ.Up.1-Kā.12 Gauḍapāda says-

**नात्मानं न परांश्चैव न सत्यं नापि चानृतम्।**

**प्राज्ञः किञ्चन संवेत्ति तुर्यं तत् सर्वदृक् सदा॥**

**Na-ātmānaṁ na parāṁ-ca-ēva na satyaṁ na-api ca-anr̥tam,**

**prājñaḥ kiñcana saṁvētti turyaṁ tat sarvadr̥k sadā.**

In prājñā, there is no cognition of visible and invisible forces. In turīya the person is in total awareness. After Buddhikośa, when we go to mahattatva and avyākṛta, world is not there. But the causal forces are in operation. Mere spandana operates. This spandana takes specific forms when it grossifies into cetana. Śankara says-

**या सा प्रज्ञा सा प्राणा या सा प्राणा सा प्रज्ञा |**

**Yā sā prajñā sā prāṇā yā sā prāṇā sā prajñā**

They call it prāṇa or prājña or avyākṛta or bīja nidrā or tamas-all are equivalent. In Kenopaniṣad (1-4) the teacher asks you to note-

**अन्यदेव तद्विदितादथो अविदितादधि।**

**Anyadēva tat-viditāt-athō aviditāt-adhi.**

It is other than the seeable and unseen world. But in turīya, even the avidita forces are dissolved.

How do you dissolve the avidita forces? You keep on reducing the vāsanā-s such as rāga, dveṣa, krodha and the creative forces like attention which captures details. Only in the focusing stage, there can be a flower, a tree etc. Objects are formed by giving contours and by giving edges. In nidrā state, because of shell expansion, the attention goes. There is sańkocata in jagrat and svapna. The sańkocata is the one that creates details of desired shape. The ānanda in nidrā is because of softness of forces. **In fact you stop attention when you want to go to nidrā.**

But when you come to turīya, none of these exist. Prāṇa is also thinned out in turīya. Even according to science, there cannot be annihilation of anything–so confinement spreads. You exist in the spread version. **It is not death but immortality**. What can nothingness die into? This nothingness is sattā. Vedānta is sometimes wonderful, but at times it is dreadful- that is why we don’t go to that state! We prefer to be safe here only. We are only more comfortable by slowing down the activity and feel happier. When the system breaks barriers, then enlightenment happens.

Even in praļaya we are all not gone. Then why bother about liberation? **Simho vā maṣako vā vyāghro vā**—**सिंहो वा मषको वा व्याघ्रो वा** the lion, the mosquito, the tiger or anybody-**tattat jñānakarma vāsanāṅkitaḥ sapraviśanti- तत्तत् ज्ञानकर्म वासनांकितः सप्रविशन्ति‍ -**they come here and retain their sūkṣma tendencies. Our tendencies do not die in praļaya or even in nidrā - this is in Chāndogya Upaniṣad. Whereas, a jñāni softens the activities and comes to a phase where even the prāṇadharma gets dropped. Such a man cannot come into the cycle of creation.

**न उत्क्रामन्ति अत्रैव अस्मिन्नेव परेणात्मना अविभागं गच्छन्ति ।**

**Na utkrāmanti atra-ēva asmin-ēva parēṇa-ātmanā avibhāgaṁ gacchanti.**

If you are not bothered about the consequences, what is wrong with performance? None of us ever complain that our heart is beating and we are carrying a burden! Softer level of activity can be there due to which there is no cause for complaint. That is mukti.

**Q.** Is there a test to know if one has grown spiritually?

**A**. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha (6-4-6) refers to this aspect thus:

**एतावदेव खलु लिङ्गमलिङ्गमूर्तेः**

**संशान्त संसृति चिरभ्रम निवृतस्य ।**

**तज्ञस्य यन्मदन कोप विषाद मोह**

**लोभापदां अनुदिनं निपुणं तनुत्वम्॥**

**Ētāvadēva khalu liṅgamaliṅga-mūrtēḥ**

**saṁśānta saṁsr̥ti cirabhrama nivr̥tasya,**

**tajñasya yan-madana kōpa viṣāda mōha**

**lōbha-āpadāṁ anudinaṁ nipuṇaṁ tanutvam.**

What are the symptoms by which we can identify the realised soul who is established in peace and for whom the eternal illusory cycle of birth and death has come to an end and who is bereft of any external symbols? He can only be identified by the gradual thinning down of forces like sex, anger, anguish, delusion and greediness day by day in him.

Rāma asks this very same question- How do you judge a jñāni? By what symptoms can I say that a person is growing? Vāsiṣṭa says that it is very difficult to label a jñāni or judge him symptomatically. He is just like any other person A jñāni has no lakṣaṇā-s - but then?- Tajñasya - for a jñāni, the forces like sex, anger, depression, confusion, greed etc. are all thinning down every day. It is a continuous process of purification.

This is a test for you also. Check whether you react or to what level you react when you are faced with the unruly forces. If you do not react then there is a marked improvement in you. Śāstra is an applicable science.

How much can one be like a Jñāni depends on one’s intensity of sādhana. It also depends on the stock of vāsanā-s one carries.

It took me twenty years to come to the level of an average man’s comfort after this clarity came to me. Sādhana cannot be a complicated one as the problems are only two. Speed and focusing are the only ones that lead one to react when confronted by evil forces. Conscious lessening/thinning of these two aspects in one’s life is the sādhana. Diffusion should start when such tendencies come. One has to develop the ‘let go’ attitude. This is all sādhana. There cannot be a third method.
