+++

_Gauḍapāda Kārikā-s are an integral part of the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. Certain portions of the Kārika-s are considered as Upaniṣad itself. Gauḍapāda was, by tradition, the philosophical grand preceptor of Śankara. His Kārika on the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad is the oldest known systematic exposition of Advaita Vedānta. The Kārika is a commentary in verse on the Upaniṣad. It falls into four sections: 1. Āgama Prakaraṇa 2.Vaitathya Prakaraṇa (Illusion) 3.Advaita Prakaraṇa (Non duality) and 4.Alātaśānti Prakaraṇa (Extinguishing a burning torch.)_

_The first section is a brief systematic exposition of the Upaniṣadic text, following its distinction of differrent states of consciousness. Several of the most important Indian commentators treat the Āgama Prakaraṇa as part of the scriptural text of Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad. _

_The second section moves beyond the text of the Upaniṣad to establish the unreality of the things experienced in dreams and by analogy, the things experienced in the waking state. All these are but MĀYĀ, illusion. Gauḍapāda emphasized the essential unity of waking and dreaming states, and argues that the waking world is as unreal as the dream-world._

_The Advaita section of the Kārika presents a clear, positive statement of the Non-Dualist position: ātman/brahman alone is real, all else is illusion. Gauḍapāda teaches the AJĀTA doctrine: the doctrine of NO-BECOMING. _

_The fourth section of the Kārika expounds the means of clearing the illusion of duality._

_As per Shastriji, the Advaita Prakaraṇa of Gaudapāda Kārika of Māṇdūkya Upaniṣad is excellent as it clarifies the doubts of a sādhaka. One should always keep ruminating on a few of them in the light of strengthening the sādhana.   So, he chose a few nuggets and has given his commentary on them.  I have reproduced them here for the reader to do introspection._
