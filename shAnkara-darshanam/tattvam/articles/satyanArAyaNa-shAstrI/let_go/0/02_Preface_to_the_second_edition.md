title = "02 Preface to the second edition"

+++

In our enthusiasm to bring out the book as quickly as possible, we hurriedly rushed through the first edition in which some small but relevant aspects were left out.  In spite of this deficiency the appreciation of the contents were valuable and prompted us to take a second look at the editing work. The suggestion from the readers who were mostly the Shatriji’s core group came in handy to look at the whole manuscript again. It is prudent to mention here that the first edition saw only a hundred copies circulated among the enthusiasts.

Many changes have been made in this edition, by revising the pattern of presentation, keeping in mind not to disturb the flow of thought so that the reader gets a clear glimpse into the subject matter.  Sanskrit verses which were added as an appendage to each lecture has been taken off and introduced wherever the need came about along with the references to the original texts.  I hope this will be of use to the reader.  Dr Lataji’s preface has been added in this edition.  The lectures on Māṇdūkya Upaniṣad have been revised and redrafted.

I am sure the reader will benefit by these changes. Suggestions are welcome for a better presentation of future editions.

Happy Reading!

Editor.
