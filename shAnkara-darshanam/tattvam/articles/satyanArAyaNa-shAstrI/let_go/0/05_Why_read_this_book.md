In what way this book is special in content and quality is a natural question that arises in the mind of any reader.  Hence it is the responsibility of the editor to highlight the salient features of this book.

Shastriji, with a strong scientific temper, began to question the orthodoxy in respect of certain vedāntic truths cherished by traditional scholars.  This led him to do intense research in Upaniṣad-s and Yoga- Vāsiṣṭa in order to find practical solutions to the problems encountered by the modern mind.

Some of his important findings which form the theme of this book are listed here:



* <u>Analysis_ _of Mind_:_</u>  All modifications of the mind are nothing but mere Spandana (movement). Human suffering can be reduced to only two aspects of mind--speed and focusing.
* <u>Happiness_:_</u> Mystery regarding happiness is removed by identifying and equating the quietened state of mind itself as happiness glorified in the Upaniṣad-s.
* <u>Sukha-Duḥkha Parīkṣa</u>:  A prakriya is a methodology which guides a person to understand and arrive at the true nature of the Self or Ātmān. There are traditional prakriyā-s like Avasthā Traya Parīkṣa, Pañca Kośa Viveka, Sthūla Sūkṣma Viveka etc.  Shastriji devised the prakriya called Sukha-Duḥkha Parīkṣa by which one can understand his   true ‘SELF’
* <u>Bhogasukha--Brahmasukha</u>: Quoting from Śankarabhāṣya and Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad-s, the role played by bhoga (enjoyment through the senses) in the experience of happiness is explained.   It is shown that CONTENTWISE Bhogasukha is essentially the same as Brahmasukha. Seeking magnified version of this happiness or Ānanda, sans the agencies, is Brahmābhāyasa.
* <u>Energy shift mechanism</u>: This explains why and how one experiences joy or happiness when sense organs come in contact with sense objects.
* <u>Omkāra Upāsana</u>:   Perhaps, Shastriji is the only one who has taken the logical explanation of Omkāra given by Adi Śankara in his commentary on Māṇḍukya Upaniṣad.  He shows how this upāsana can lead a sādhaka to slip into deep silence.
* <u>Śubhakarma_:  _</u>Shastriji classifies all mundane, mechanical, neutral, non exciting activities like sweeping the floor, washing dishes etc as Śubhakarma and explains how these activities can help in attaining purification of mind.
* <u>Freedom element_:_</u>  He identifies that freedom is a unique and special quality of a human mind and this facility can be used to overcome the feeling of helplessness and bondage.
* <u>Boredom forces</u>:  Identifies boredom as anādyavidyā. By using the energy shift mechanism it is shown how boredom is generated and how it can be overcome.
* <u>Concept of Brahman</u>: Demystifies the concept of Brahman and concept of enlightenment. The modern scientific mind cannot appreciate the traditional model of creation according to which the universe has come into being by an utterly non doing principle called Brahman.  An attempt has been made by this scholar in overcoming this hurdle by using Calculus model.  This needs careful consideration by modern scientists.  According to Shastriji, enlightenment cannot happen overnight as it is a gradual process.
* Siddhānta and Sādhana_:_  It is shown that vedāntic truths need not remain as traditional jargons.  Most of them can be applied as a means of sādhana to reach the goal.

Quoting examples from day to day problems faced by men and women  in their daily life, he goes on to show how everyone  can lead a happy life if one were to understand how and why of the rules laid down by our ancestors for living one’s complete life.  Drawing many quotes from Upaniṣad-s, Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha and Bhagavad-Ġīta, he has shown that by sādhana one can attain bliss in this very life itself.
