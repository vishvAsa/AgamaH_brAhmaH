A work of this type cannot happen without the effort of a group of dedicated persons. My brother Rangarajan, Prof. Naagabhushan, Mr. Gopal who had an intimate and long association with Shastriji have been the prime movers of this programme.   All the three have spent many hours with me   for realising this project by helping me with the transcription, by putting it into a readable format. They spent hours of their precious time by going through the pages line by line and made the necessary correction keeping in mind, the Shastriji’s style of narration.    My school mate Sreenivasa Murthy spent his time with me correcting the proof.  My thanks goes to all of them.

Recording of these lectures were done at Detroit, U.S.A.at the residence of Smt Aruna, daughter of Shastriji in the year 2002.  Our sincere thanks to her for providing the tapes for transcriptions.

Dr Nagendra, Vice Chancellor of Sri Vivekānanda Yoga Anusandhāna Samsthāna (SVYASA) has been a motivating force behind the project. My special thanks to him.

Transliteration work of the book was done by Dr Ishwarprasad.  My sincere thanks to him.

I have a long list of students of Shastriji to acknowledge. I cannot   forget them for their support. Prominent among them is Mr. Vinayak Joshi who has relentlessly worked to keep the record of Shastriji’s talks and shared the same.

Mr. Ranganath Prasad did the transcription work related to the talks and typing work of Sanskrit text also.   He has been a helping hand whenever I wanted him and stayed with me till the book took a final shape.  I am indebted to him.  Prof K S Shreedharan who took all the pains to correct the Sanskrit texts needs special mention here.   I thank him profusely.

Dr Lata Hemchand**,**Professor of Psychology, Richmond Fellowship Post Graduate College, 40-1/4, Vajpeyam Gardens, Bangalore who incidentally is an ardent follower of Shastriji, supported our work and very eagerly agreed to write a foreword to this book.  My sincere thanks to her.

My   publishers--------took enough pains to bring this to a  happy end within a very short time given to them.

Lastly I thank my wife Rukmiṇi whose patience I tested by working into late nights and disturbing her sleep for quite a long time.
