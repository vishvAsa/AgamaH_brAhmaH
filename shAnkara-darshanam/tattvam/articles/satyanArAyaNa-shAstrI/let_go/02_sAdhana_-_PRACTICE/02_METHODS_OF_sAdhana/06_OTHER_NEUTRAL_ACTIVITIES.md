title = "06 OTHER NEUTRAL ACTIVITIES"

+++

For some people, japa is not sufficient for expenditure of large amounts of energy. For them, still a courser activity is required for spending the stock of energy. Japa is inner articulation. For that reason, our ancestors suggested the use of loud chanting of names of the Lord. Again this is a neutral activity. They designed the Sandhyā-Vandana which was a still coarser method. Performance of this involves time, resulting in spending larger amounts of the bothering energy.

Hindus have the practice of offering Śodaśa Pūja to God every day. They have Aṣṭottara-Nāma-s or Sahasra-Nāmā-s for each Deity. They have a number of Vrata-s which are being celebrated throughout the year. Each such Vrata is having its own discipline and code for itsperformance resulting in expenditure of energy.

The above list is not exhaustive and Karmakāṇḍa is full of such practices giving plenty of choice to us. Since japa was an inner activity and was not sufficient, loud chanting would help drain the energy. This would not only clear stock of energy but also induces concentration. Om Keśavāya namaḥ etc. was incidental. If you can watch the ājñācakra while the chanting goes on you will find that you are in comfort.

Although our elders prescribed these methods, they could not explain why such an activity was needed since they did not understand the mechanism involved. They themselves would fret and fume once they were finished with the pūja hours. The citta that had gathered a small amount of peace during the pūja would be more than spoiled soon after they came out of pūja. The gains were lost and therefore big progress could not happen. Anger did not go, depression did not go, and complaining did not go due to lack of understanding. Now that we know this, we should make use of the methods suggested to attain peace within ourselves. If the student of karmakāṇḍa knew that he was doing the pūja for cittaśuddhi then he would have extended the peace that was generated during pūja and attain better mental state. Once he knows why he has to do pūja, then the whole problem is sorted out. Minus this knowledge it was only a local gain and not a complete gain.

If present generation gets such clarity of mind, what was thought as meaningless and incompatible religious practices, becomes beneficial and meaningful.

I laughed at Hinduism in my college days, ridiculed the gāyatri japa and all that. Now, I am the very fellow advocating gāyatri to everyone. A very big scientist from an Institute in Bangalore, who swore by Sartre and ridiculed everything that is in Hinduism, is now learning Puruṣasūkta and other mantra-s, once he got an exposure to this science of Vedānta and its importance. Concentrating on GOD is not as tiring as concentrating on a mundane thing because of the role of rāga and dveṣa in the latter and absence of it in the former. That has to be taken notice of. That is why ultimately when we come to sādhana, we shift from the unholy to the holy. If you keep thinking of God, violent emotions do not bother you, do not cripple you.

A famous Mexican philosopher who knew this point advised his student to get the lessons in non doing. How did he teach? He asked his student to walk around his house clasping both the hands, keeping them behind his back, thirty times in the morning, thirty times in the afternoon and thirty times in the evening. The student took this seriously and did as prescribed by his teacher for six months. This sort of neutral activity put the student in the phase of non doing.

**Q.** Even though I am doing japa and sahasranāma the mind is getting preoccupied. How to sort this out?

**A.** Do not bother. Because, the quantum of pre occupied energy which set the preoccupying thought, is one tenth now as nine tenths are spent in japa and thus its effect is much less now.

Please note that any mechanical activity, like sweeping the floor can be turned into Yoga when you cannot sit for mediation due to inner pressure. Everyone, including me becomes helpless at certain times and the point is to ignore the helplessness and proceed with sādhana. The rush for things has to go. Vegetable cutting does not require buddhi. These methods are for a non believer in religion. One has to have some work to spend the energy- that is all the purpose of any method of sādhana. So, take up work in the kitchen which does not excite you. Irrespective of the nature of the work involved your attention should be on the result. In fact, all karmakāṇḍin-s should have got very high benefits by their practice but they did not get it. Knowing why of the method makes all the difference.
