      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jñanamarga, as Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa’s definition goes, is&lt;strong&gt;samyak avekṣaṇam-&lt;/strong&gt; whatever wrong notions we have, about the nature of sukha and about our own nature, we correct them by right ideas. This is the safest method and is most productive. A sick person can do that, a paralytic patient can do that, a woman with a child can do that, a suckling mother can do that, a boy can do that because there is no toil in this process and there is no struggle. By simple suggestions, one can counter duḥkha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yogaḥ citta vṛtti nirodhaḥ&lt;/strong&gt;as per Patanjali. **yogo cittarodhohi-**as per Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha.  In the later, through suggestions you are softening the mind and purifying it, whereas in the former, you are actually controlling the forces. I hope you see the slight difference there. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha further declares that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;मनः प्रशमनोपायो योग इत्यभिधीयते ।&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manaḥ praśamanōpāyō yōga iti-abhidhīyatē.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 3-9-132)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mellowing the mind is termed as yoga. It is tuning the mind from the harsh state to gentle state. So, sit and quieten the mind. You decide an interval of time where your duty calls would not come and disturb you. That is the skill with which you have to work. You have to be in a relaxed state for attaining peace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>03 ŚUBHAKARMA (PIOUS NEUTRAL ACTIVITIES)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have understood the main difference between Jñānamārga and Yogamārga and have studied the various methods that can be adopted to mellow the mind. The question arises now as to why we should look for other methods of sādhana when these two methods are more than sufficient to put us in the desired path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If one carefully examines, these two paths are very difficult to adopt for common people like us who have great load of rajas and tamas compared to those who are advanced in their pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>04 SĀKĀRADHYĀNA (MEDITATION ON A FORM)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We will now discuss the details of practice to be undertaken at each functional centre. Let us first take up the &lt;strong&gt;CITTA&lt;/strong&gt;or the mind centre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you sit and start contemplating on Brahma (Nirguṇabrahma), you will only waste your time ending up in developing headache. Instead, have a picture of God of your choice and engage your mind on that. It is a wonderful tool in your hands. Now you relate yourself with your Iṣṭadevata. If you are a Hindu you have many gods to choose. If you are Christian, then keep a picture of Jesus or Mother Mary. A certain amount of sanctity is also established by that process which will be helpful. You can even think of your Guru. If both god and guru are not acceptable to you, then have a candle light to gaze. You are connected with a person or thing which &lt;u&gt;does not excite the mind&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>05 JAPA (CHANTING OF HOLY NAME)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Till now we looked at the optical centre- a picture. The next centre is the &lt;strong&gt;Śabdasthāna&lt;/strong&gt; or sound as a medium.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you come down to the śabdasthāna, the same principle has to work that the bothering energy must be spent away and during that process mind is not excited. The prescription given under this centre is called &lt;strong&gt;JAPA.&lt;/strong&gt; Continuous repetition of God’s name or a Mantra or a chosen word introduced at this centre is termed as japa&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>06 OTHER NEUTRAL ACTIVITIES</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For some people, japa is not sufficient for expenditure of large amounts of energy. For them, still a courser activity is required for spending the stock of energy. Japa is inner articulation. For that reason, our ancestors suggested the use of loud chanting of names of the Lord. Again this is a neutral activity. They designed the Sandhyā-Vandana which was a still coarser method. Performance of this involves time, resulting in spending larger amounts of the bothering energy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>07 KARMAYOGA (PATH OF SELFLESS ACTION)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you say you have no time for doing any of the above mentioned sādhanā-s since your profession takes away much of the time, there is an alternative method for such situations. For such persons Karma yoga is the remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bhagavadgīta dwells on this in great detail and wherein Sri Kṛṣṇa elaborates on the approach to one’s activities. This, I think is the biggest research tried only in Bhagavadgīta. We shall take up the important points from that and see how it fits in to our sādhana. There are four main aspects in karma yoga.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We went through śubha-karmamārga which was very important since we cannot always use -Jñānamārga and Yogamārga. We have to incorporate karmakāṇḍa methods of doing pūja, reciting sahasranāma, etc. as an alternative. Apart from these any karma which is not exciting can be taken up in our daily lives as a portion of our time table wherein the boredom forces can be easily dissolved. One needs to take care that the activities so taken up should not raise kāma and krodha. Number of such tricks are available and one can use them just to spend the time and energy. Forget that some God gives you benefit. It is the śubhakarma which will keep you in a peaceful mode. Unknowingly you are in a soft state of mind during those hours. You are nearer to brahmasthiti. What was left over in our study was another method which is called &lt;strong&gt;Bhaktimārga- भक्तिमार्ग&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;or Prēmamārga- प्रेममार्ग&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>09 DHARMA (RIGHTEOUNESS) – AS A TOOL OF SĀDHANA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shastriji”s concept of Dharma throws light on a variety of modern way of thinking and the apprehensions of the younger generation regarding the old value systems enunciated in the dhārmic principles. A totally new dimension has been opened by Shastriji by way of his arguments which capture the imagination of the youngsters.  His primary aim of using any method to tame the mind to attain peace and tranquillity leads one to think positively about applying dhārmic tenets in one’s own daily lives as a means of sādhana to achieve happiness.  The reader has to keep this in mind while reading the chapter on Dharma as a means of sādhana   &amp;mdash;  Editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
