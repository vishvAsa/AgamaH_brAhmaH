title = "09 DHARMA (RIGHTEOUNESS) – AS A TOOL OF SĀDHANA"

+++

_Shastriji”s concept of Dharma throws light on a variety of modern way of thinking and the apprehensions of the younger generation regarding the old value systems enunciated in the dhārmic principles. A totally new dimension has been opened by Shastriji by way of his arguments which capture the imagination of the youngsters.  His primary aim of using any method to tame the mind to attain peace and tranquillity leads one to think positively about applying dhārmic tenets in one’s own daily lives as a means of sādhana to achieve happiness.  The reader has to keep this in mind while reading the chapter on Dharma as a means of sādhana   ---  Editor_

The truths of the Upaniṣad-s form the theoretical base, supporting the other two components namely Karma and Dharma. We have a wing called Karmānuṣṭhāna which is prescribed by the Karmakāṇḍa portion of the vedas, with so many rituals, pūjā-s, prayers, Gods, demigods and their spouses. You can call them power centres if you don’t like the idea of Gods.

The same can be compared to a central Government where in, we have a Prime Minister and many subordinate ministers who are conducting duties as per the instruction of their head. There is a replica of what is in our macrocosm life. For example, Varuṇa represents the water component, Agni represents a thermal component, Sūrya represents a light component etc.

There is a cetana, which by a powerful kumbhana establishes a potential as a result of which, kinetic energy can flow. He can keep on releasing thermal or light energy which is backed by a terrible kumbhana. Our kumbhana (holding the breath) is of half minute duration. When you go to your expansive phase, you can have a kumbhana outside of your body and that can be established for years. That is how these power centres are operated.

Closely integrated with the karma aspect, there is the Dharma aspect also. This is the sādhana portion of the karmakāṇḍa. The theory portion of Dharma is covered in the message of Upaniṣads. Man thought that sukha was in the objects of enjoyments and the indriyā-s connecting them. A connection between the viśaya and viśayi gives us the sense of joy. That is a surface truth. But the real truth is that when viśaya and viśayi come together, the joy or sukha results in an empty state of mind.

See the enormous difference between the first and the second conclusion. Eating gives me joy. Any sweet dish gives me joy. The corresponding indriya and the required object getting a contact produces the happy state – 

**विषयिविषयसम्बन्धजनितः सुखः॥**

**Viṣayi-viṣaya-sambandha-janitaḥ sukhaḥ.**

If the question was pushed further as to what gave you joy inside, the answer would be that the mind became empty because of a peculiar mechanism of contact. The real content of happiness is not in the bhogavastu. It is only a means, but in reality, citta or the mind becoming empty by which you touch your nijasvarūpa or brahmasvarūpa. This is the common thing in the whole of Universe which is brahmamātrata. A terrible silence or a terrible non doing principle is the basic composition of everything on this earth. The essence of Indian thinking is to realize this and experience that non doing state—which is otherwise known as attaining MOKṣA, which is the goal of every one.

Dharma_, _artha_, _kāma and mokṣa, are the four puruśārthā-s_ - _is the essence of Indian thinking. Indian vision has given utter clarity about these and there is no mystery about this. Every time you are in happiness, you are touching your source. A magnified version of that joy is svarūpa. If you are continuously there in a steadfast way, that is liberation. Karmakāṇḍa leads you to that state. Taming the unruly forces is the point of importance in karmakāṇḍa.

Dharma is also a portion of karmakāṇḍa. Dharma is the practical side of knowledge. It is the working region of the theory we have learnt through upaniṣadic study.

What is Dharma? A simple definition of Dharma is very difficult. Our sages have given three or four orthodox definitions. They are biblical in their representation. We shall look into them.

**धारणात् धर्म इति अभिधीयते** ॥

**Dhāraṇāt dharma iti abhidhīyatē**.

One thinker puts a definition as, ‘anything that holds on to is Dharma’. The universe is held -the cosmic flow is maintained and therefore it is Dharma. Whatever sustains the progress of the universe is dharma. It sounds dignified but that does not help in our practice.

**धर्मो रक्षति रक्षितः  - Dharmō rakṣati rakṣitaḥ**.

If you practice dharma, dharma itself takes care of your welfare. Your Iha- इह and Para- पर are taken care of if you live in a dhārmic way... Again this definition also is vague as far as its practice is concerned. Śankara always gives importance to this, as it is more orthodox -

**चोदनालक्षणःधर्मः  - Cōdana-lakṣaṇaḥ dharmaḥ  -**

Wwhatever śāstra is telling you in terms of dos and don’ts is dharma.

All these do not give us a sustainable position as far as practice is concerned. This is more orthodox in nature. This also did not help me when I went as an earnest research student. Notwithstanding this difficulty, we have number of dhārmic tenets or dhārmic practices observed in every Hindu home even without knowing definition of dharma. In Taittirīya Upaniṣad-Śikshāvalli, the following are a few dhārmic injunctions:

**Satyam vada, Dharmam cara- सत्यं वद धर्मं चर।** Always speak the truth and follow dharma.

**मातृदेवो भव, पितृदेवो भव, आचार्यदेवो भव।**

**Mātr̥dēvō bhava, pitr̥dēvō bhava, ācāryadēvō bhava**

Hold Mother as God, Father as God, Teacher as God etc. These are all orders from a guru to the disciple when he leaves the ashram after the study.

Whereas it is not mandatory in the west to take care of their parents in their old age, it is a dictum in Hindu Dharma. All the problems of providing separate shelter and facility for the old are just struck off by an injunction in Hindu tenets which says that they have to be looked upon as ‘gods’ and hence to be cared for. What a safe society it becomes when dharma tenets are applied? **Mātr̥vat paradārāṁśca  - मातृवत् परदारांश्च**। Look at this great thinking. Every woman other than your wife is a mother like to you. If man were to practice this dharma, all crimes born out of illegitimate relationships get routed out and society becomes safe. Rape and kill is a very common affair now a days and this can be eradicated if one were to follow this tenet. In Taittirīya Upaniṣad (3-7, 8) we have following mantra:

**अन्नं न निंद्यात् तद्व्रतम् ।**

**Annaṁ na niṁdyāt tadvratam.**

**अन्नं न परिचक्षीत तद्व्रतम् ।**

**Annaṁ na paricakṣīta tadvratam.**

**अन्नं बहुकुर्वीत ।**

**Annaṁ bahukurvīta.**

**न  कञ्चन वसतौ प्रत्याचक्षीत तद्व्रतम् ।**

**Na kañcana vasatau pratyācakṣīta tadvratam.**

His vow is that he should not deprecate food. One should not neglect food. One should try to increase the quantity of food one has. If someone comes and asks for a place to stay, one should not turn him away.

Taken in a worldly sense, if the money earned by whatever means is used for making food and distributing, then it is not unholy. What a daring statement! Even a scoundrel cannot be denied food. Nobody should die of starvation was the motto. So far as other gifts are concerned, one has to see merits and demerits in distribution but not when it comes to cooked food.

**Dāna** and **Aparigraha**are the next two important tenets. Half the crime in our society is due to hunger and wrong sex. Once the society is assured of the food and shelter, where is the crime? Big issues are simply taken care of by a simple practice of this tenet of Dharma. Every Hindu family indulges in charity. From the birth of to the cremation stage, charity is practiced.

If you see a Hindu lady performing a ritual, she gives away a coconut along with a piece of cloth, as gift after the pūja. Tagged on to that is aparigraha. As far as you are concerned, you politely refuse a dāna and say that you are bound by a ritual and cannot accept anything. Though you are in need, you refrain from taking, just to protect dharma. These two disciplines are put on a high pedestal. If practiced by all, there cannot be poverty in the society. If haves can decide to lead a simple life, their excess money will flow back to society for welfare of the needy.

While we have any number of dhārmic tenets in our society, I am not able to get at one single definition by which I can classify an act as dhārmic or otherwise. What is the common factor in all these dhārmic tenets? We still do not have a clear vision of Dharma. This calls for a deeper study of dharma. While this is one aspect of Dharma, we have another aspect where there is an excuse even when the dhārmic tenets are broken.

Let us take the case of Ahalya who was the dharma patni of sage Gautama. She fell in love with Indra who stealthily came and had sex with her and then she is cursed by the sage and becomes a stone. Rāmapāda sparṣa releases her from that state and then the ŗşi Gautama accepts her. Here, we have to see an important point. A pativrata who has to keep herself committed to dharma by thought, deed and action (kāyā vācā and manasā) had erred and keepers of Dharma could have banished her. But the Ŗşi accepts her. How do we justify Dharma here? We feel that there is an inconsistency. We have given the status of a mahāpativratā to Ahalya in spite of specific violations of dharma.

Take the case of Draupadi. While the pātivratya-dharma allowed only one husband, she is a woman who takes five men and still considered a pativratā. Our own definitions are contradicted and there seems to be no consistency in dhārmic values, is the argument of a modern day thinker. Can we be so foolish as to be inconsistent?

Take the case of sage Parāśara. He has come near a shore and is waiting for a boat. He sits in a boat and sees that a girl is rowing the boat. He invites her for company. She is shocked and is reluctant and says that she is still a virgin. She requests the sage to take the permission of her father as she has no objection to marry him as he is a worthy person. The sage brushes away her request and persuades her. The girl is afraid that a Mahaŗṣi can curse her and accepts the request reluctantly and that event gives birth to Vyāsa. If we examine this incident, even ordinary persons like us would not have done such a thing. This urgency is not pardonable. Situation is all the more important since he is a Mahaŗṣi. It is surprising to note that he is called Bhagavān Parāśara before the act and after the act also. Look at the complexity.

When we come to the story of Kṛṣṇa, it is terrifying again. He is called a thief till he was five, when he is a boy he is an eve teaser, when maturity comes he is an unscrupulous fighter in warfare. To protect the Pāndavā-s in their war against the Kauravā-s, he makes Ghatodgaja- a victim, Abhimanyu- a victim. Karṇa is treacherously handled. Bhīşma is cleverly disposed of. Droṇa is made to give up arms at the stroke of a lie. Despite this, he is considered as God. Can Dharma be so bad?

Dharma which looked so simple, takes up such strides where specific violations of dharma have been committed. Overlooking these objections, all the above involved characters continue to be glorified in religion. So, there is a need to go deep into the study of dharma. To substantiate all these and accommodate them in the tenets of dharma, bothered me for years... I had to do five years of research to get some satisfactory answer.

We shall try to define dharma. If one has to give a simplest initial definition, one can say dharma is** NYĀYA.** Nyāya is, good returned with good. If you give me a gift on a festival day, it is reasonable for me to return the same on some other day. It follows therefore - bad returned with bad also. This is called tit for tat - Punish the evil and reward the good is a vision of nyāya. This is all the scope of nyāya and no further. But dharma goes beyond nyāya. What is that which goes beyond this nyāyadṛṣṭi and offers something more? Where does dharma excel nyāya?

To give an example, take the case of professor who earns a fat salary. His neighbour is a poor school master who earns a meagre salary. The professor celebrates festivals with all pomp and pleasure where as the school master celebrates the same in a very humble way. Professor does not share his wealth with the school master. He need not do that. This is nyāyadṛṣṭi. If on the other hand, he understands the situation and goes to the neighbour with some gifts and sweets and offers them to the teacher without hurting the pride of the teacher, then he has lifted himself from the levels of nyāya to the regions of dharma. See the difference. He is setting a new dimension which was not available till then. Sharing is not an obligation here. A virtue called sharing has come into the picture here. This is how dharma excels nyāya. We have number of examples in our life to substantiate this point.

I have the example of a colleague of mine who led a bachelor’s life and was very miserly as far as his comforts were concerned. But, he had the greatness of looking after his mother who was eighty years old, spent all his money and got his six sisters married. This was the level of sacrifice he did, ignoring his own personal life. He would go to the extent of paying the fees of students in his class who were not in a position to meet the deadline. This is not called for in the regions of nyāya and goes somewhere beyond.

Many references from the Upanişad-s are available and I will place before you a story from one of them. Three representatives, one from Devaloka, one from Dānavaloka and one from Mānavaloka went to Prajāpati, the creator, to seek wisdom. Prajāpati, being a very inert person uttered only one word ‘da’ to satisfy all the three of them. Each person understood this as it suited him. The devatā-s took it as ‘dama’, the dānavā-s took it as ‘dayā’ and the mānavā-s took it as ‘dāna’. Dānava-s thought that they were very harsh. So they felt that they should show compassion and be less cruel. They felt that they had to cultivate dayā. Manavā-s thought that they had to practice dāna as they were miserly and the devatā-s understood that they had to have moderation in their indulgence and took it as Dama,

These three can be taken as the tenets of dharma. We were trying to search for a right definition as to which is the right dhārmic trait and now we have these three aspects which can be used to test them. Dayā or **Prema,**Dāna or**tyāga**and Dama or** nigraha **are the three aspects of the dharma principle. If anything is valuable in any religion it is these three things. Even Jesus Christ approved of these three aspects for a holistic living. Compassion was not available in the regions of Nyāya till the above dhārmic tenets were introduced in the religion.

We can now see the subtle shades that distinguish one from the other. In the eastern world we can give examples of hundreds of persons who practiced dharma. Now that we have a complete definition of dharma, one is considered dhārmic if any one of the three principles mentioned above is practiced. I will take three examples from epics to show these aspects-**Compassion**or prema,**charity**or tyāga and **control**or nigraha.

I will take an episode from Rāmāyaṇa. The situation is the coronation of the heir to the throne of King Daśaratha. The king has decided to appoint Rāma as his heir and an announcement to this effect has been made and the message is conveyed to queen Kaikeyi. Kaikeyi does not approve of this and wants to cash on the two boons the king had given to her some time ago. She wants Rāma to go to the forest for fourteen years and her son Bharata to be installed on the throne. King Daśaratha is bound by his words to the queen. Kaikeyi manages to get Rāma to her chambers to inform the decision.

The context here is very important. Rāma has been accepted as king and preparations are in full swing and there is joy everywhere. Rāma expects that he would be greeted by both the king and the queen. But the queen tells him otherwise. What a lift at the announcement of coronation and what a fall when he has been told that he has to go to forest, clad in the dress of an ascetic. There was not a simple frown on Rāma’s face. That showed the preparedness of Rāma for upholding dharma, by honouring the word given by his father to the queen. He was ready to accept the order at the drop of a hat and give up kingship. But the queen is in a hurry to send him away as quickly as possible to make sure that Rāma did not change his mind. That was her anxiety. Rāma is called maryādā- purusha as he was never disturbed at any time. Rāma tells the queen that he will not change his mind even if the world tries to persuade him, since he has accepted the order of the queen who is like mother to him. This is where we can see the difference between Nyāyadṛṣṭi and dharmadṛṣṭi.

In front of all other queens and sage Vasiṣṭha, Lakṣmaṇa, the brother of Rāma, argues and tells his brother that there is no need for him to go to the forest and puts forth three points to support the Nyāyadṛṣṭi. Firstly, it is the birth right of the eldest son to become the king. The promise or boon given by the king has no place there and Rāma need not fulfil his promise. Secondly, the king being old seemed to have lost his senses and is unable to decide which is good and which is bad and hence there is no need to obey the king. Thirdly, the king seems to have got attracted by the young queen by blind love, hence Rāma need not take the word of the king seriously. If they decide to take the kingship by force, as his brother, he would singlehandedly destroy them. Hence, Rāma should not have any fear in ignoring the words of the foolish queen. He further asserts that Rāma is the most deserving son of Daśaratha for kingship. This was the Nyāyadṛṣṭi put forth by Lakṣmaṇa. Even Kausalya and sage Vasiṣṭha also say that the order is unjust. Rāma at this juncture puts forth his points in favour of his decision. He says that one should not look at the issue as put forth by Lakşmaṇa. That was not the way of studying the problem. There is no place for debate when the duty of the son is, to obey the father’s words and free him from that burden. The dharma of any son is to protect the words of the father. Under such a situation, no argument to dislodge the order was acceptable. So, the case is settled as dharma tenets have to be upheld and arguments of Nyāya do not fit in. When other equally noble souls argue on the basis of Nyāya, Rāma takes a different stand upholding the dhārmic values. This shows up to what level one can go and be mentally prepared to accept whatever comes in the way. That was how Rāma applied nigraha and tyāga components of Dhrama.

Another example from Rāmāyaṇa is worth mentioning where Rāma acts in a balanced way when the war between him and Rāvaṇa becomes imminent. He was told that Rāvaṇā’s brother Vibhīşaṇa, with his four followers, is coming to his camp. A deliberation is on whether to accept him or not since he is from the enemy quarters. Rāma is quietly watching when Sugriva says that Vibhīşaṇa should not be let in as he might be having foul motives. He may be trying to find out the war strategy. Lakşmaṇa is in agreement with that point of view. Hanumantha at this point makes a balancing act by saying that he has judged them as noble souls when he visited Lanka for the first time. Hence, they should be given a hearing. Rāma, after listening to all these arguments, says that the case here is not of any fear of someone with evil designs. Being a kshatriya, it is his Dhrama to give protection to anyone who came to him for help. Vālmiki’s śloka from Rāmāyaṇa is excellent here.

**सकृदेव प्रपन्नाय तवास्मीति च याचत ।**

**अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यः ददामि एतद्व्रतम् मम॥**

**Sakr̥dēva prapannāya tava-asmi-iti ca yācata,**

**abhayaṁ sarva-bhūtēbhyaḥ dadāmi ētat-vratam mama.** (VālmikiRāmāyaṇa)

Rāma is at his best- If a person comes _to_ him once saying that he is helpless and is at his mercy, he will give protection from all the enemy forces which is acting against him. This is the dharma of a kşatriya and particularly of a king like him.

These are lessons to show us how dharma differs from Nyāyadṛṣṭi and how far you can stick to dharma if you so desire and make your life noble.

Now we take another story of Bhīşma from Mahābhārata. We know about the King Śāntanu and Bhīşma is born to him from Queen Ganga. He is also known as Devavrata. One day while Śāntanu was hunting, he feels a fragrant smell and follows the trail of that and finds a girl of eighteen. He falls in love with her. He is unable to express the pangs and gets depressed and stays lonely in the palace. Devavrata comes to know of this and tries to find out the reason through the people who had accompanied his father on the hunting trip.

He goes in search of that girl (matsyagandhi, girl with fragrance due to the boon given by sage Parāśara) and informs her father that King Śāntanu had sought her for marriage. The father of the girl is happy and puts a condition that the son born out of his daughter should be made the king of Hastināpur. This was a very big request to be accepted as Devavrata could lose the position of a king. But, he readily obliges and takes a vow that even his children would not take the throne. To fulfil this end, he would remain a bachelor. He made two promises that he would reject not only the kingship but also marriage with any woman. This was a terrible sacrifice for the sake of his father. Even the devatā-s were stunned by such an impossible vow. And they named him Bhīşma.

This goes to show to what level one can sacrifice to make a mark for himself. If any one of us were in that position, we would not have dared to make such a promise. We would have probably advised our fathers that they should abandon the lust at that age! We would have asked them to change their ways if such a situation arose. But here is a boy of eighteen or twenty who deserved the company of a woman more than his aged father, at the drop of a hat, agrees to the request of not only losing his right to marry but also lose the kingship. While we are always tempted to go by Nyāyadṛṣṭi, Devavrata went by the Dharmadṛṣṭi.

The next example is the story of Karṇa from Mahābhārata. Karṇa is a tragic hero of Mahabhārata, unfairly treated by the mother. Karṇa was invincible and Indra, who was anxious of the safety of his son Arjuna, comes in the disguise of a Brahmin. Indra knew that Karṇa had a vrata that he would not refuse the request of anyone who came to him asking for a help especially when he is doing the ritual of Arghyapradāna (oblations). Indra demands that he should part with kavaca which was with him since birth, by pouring water along with the gift. In spite of warning by his father Surya who clearly tells Karṇa that the person who has come to ask is none other than Indra himself and the gift would result in his death in the battlefield, Karṇa still obliges the Brahmin. That was the Dharmadṛṣṭi, where as the Nyāyadṛṣṭi is to think whether or not it is right to oblige when a seeker comes with a foul intention. Karṇa, who respected his vrata more than anything, did not care if the intention of the seeker was good or bad.

So, these are examples to show in a subtle way how a Nyāyadṛṣṭi differed from Dharmadṛṣṭi and are examples to reach those ideals as much as we can. But, the real question begins here.

Here, let us recollect the incident which I narrated some days ago wherein the post doctoral student of Theology rejected the religious tenets outright stating that religion is a joy killer.

Can you see the ruthless attack on religion in two directions! It has no self defence by way of arguing itself as right. Everyone wants to have a free life of indulgence and thinks it is his right. Indulgence gives him joy. More indulgence is more joyful. It is quite a natural demand as the purpose of life is happiness.  religion can probably defend itself against such a reasonable attack.

We cannot call that student foolish to be dismissed or ignored as he is a post doctoral student. The student in question says that unless the religion or the advocates of religion, give a justifying answer, he is not satisfied. The best part of the booklet was that the teacher confesses that he had no answer nor he could find any answers in the religious texts.

In the present days, if one observes the world over, youngsters are going into ways of too much of distraction and spoiling themselves in the name of worldly pleasures which are giving them misery instead of happiness. So, tenets of Dharma have to be carefully studied and adopted in every mode of our life.

Most of us argue that dhārmic principles are dependent on time and place and so also nyāya and there is no constant factor. That is the problem we are facing today. If Dharma had the constancy and is independent of time, then all our religious practices should not have changed. Most of us do not practice them. In the days of religious tightness, lot of prescriptions used to be there and people adhered to them. Whether Dhārmic values should remain intact and rigid is to be answered when we think of redefining Dharma.

It is possible to restructure Dharma when we are in a position to understand the why of Dharma and have a full vision of dharma. Our notion earlier was dharma is for dharma’s sake. Now we have a higher vision. Whereas, all of us thought that the values of Dharma are highest, the doctoral student threw a challenge on us. He insisted that prema, tyāga and nigraha are simply a negation of indulgence. He went on to say that sukha was in Bhoga and religion was putting a check on his joy.

The student is right in saying that everybody is in need of joy. That cannot be questioned. But then, it can be shown, by applying restraints, which is the best factor of every religion, everlasting joy can be easily attained. This was shown in detail when we discussed the concept of sukha and duḥkha-parīkṣa. Religion does not take you away from joy. Religion can help you to reach a lasting joy. Bhogasukha gives momentary joy preceded by restlessness, succeeded by restlessness. Religion gives you complete stretch of joy. Once that is accepted, the whole world can turn religious. The great ethical, moral, religious, dhārmic values simply get restored. That is the beauty of Vedānta.

When everyone questions the religious methods and its practises, the doctoral student in question may seem right as far as logic goes. But, he is unable to see what an amount of effort has gone in formatting these ideas to give him permanent happiness if he were to accept them after a careful study. Dharma gets restored even without our knowledge if IndriyaNigraha is applied as a balancing act in all our actions.

The seemingly mischievous question, but very well laid out from the postdoctoral student, is very well met and therefore religion has a strong point to defend itself. All the religions have Prema, Tyāga and Nigraha as common values. We can now appreciate every religion. Now, this is a wonderful explanation which tells us why of Dharma. <u>All the three tenets prema, tyāga and nigraha ultimately take you to pure state of mind or a no mind state</u>. And this state, as we have seen, is the state of ānanda. Even Bhogasukha, corresponds to a momentary mental peace. So Dharma is one which can take me to mokṣa, a quietened state of mind, a soft or gentle state of mind. Dharma is not an end in itself but a means to a nobler state of mind which is ānanda. We can now give a more encompassing and richer definition to Dharma. <u>Whatever action which takes one to a state of mahā śānti is Dharma.</u> This is a better and more convenient definition than the earlier one of Prema, Tyaga and Nigraha.

We also have problems while dealing with some aspects of dharma. How do we justify some of the acts mentioned below as dhārmic acts?

Take the case of Bhishma of Mahābhārata who stood by the Kauravā-s and fights battle with the Pāņdavā-s although he knew that they were not the right people. His only explanation for supporting the bad King is to satisfy the promise given by him to Matsyagandhi that he would protect the kingdom and her progeny. He affirms that, as a citizen also, it is his dharma to protect the king and he stands by it.

In another case in Rāmāyaṇa, Vibhīşana deserts the king Rāvaṇa although he was his brother, as Rāvaṇa turns a deaf ear to all his good advice. Vibhishana goes to the enemy camp to avoid his non righteous brother. He not only goes there but tells all the secrets and helps Rāma in defeating Rāvaṇa.

Two people under identical situations take opposite views. In the case of Bhīşma, he decides to stay with the bad King. Whereas, Vibhīşaṇa decides to disown the bad King though he was his own brother and had given him the support all through. What is this confusion? It is a good case for attack by any one. In spite of this, in the eyes of deciders of Dharma, both are termed as Mahātmās. Both are termed as Dharmiṣṭā-s. If dharma were to be an end in itself, both cannot be right. If dharma were to be for dharma’s sake the two cannot be termed as Dharmiṣṭhā-s. Only one can be right and the other can be wrong. But we have now got a superior definition. <u>Whatever takes you to permanent happiness is Dharma</u>. Bhīşma acted as a custodian of a promise. Bhīşma as a vrataniṣṭha had no axe to grind. He was not acting as a coward. He had no cheap mortal motives. For purification of his mind or for higher scruples he stood by the side of a bad king taking it as his Dharma.

Same is the case with Vibhīşaṇa who was against any injustice being committed by his own brother. He was not craving for the throne. He was acting with the background of keeping his mind clean. The action is not as important as the motive behind. Here we can argue as to why Bhīşma did not act as Vibhīşaṇa. It is the question of one’s preference. Thus both are termed as Dharmiṣṭhā-s <u>An act done in the background of Chittashudhi or for the expansion of Chitta is Dharma</u>.

In the case of Paraśurāma who slayed his mother at the behest of his father, the argument can be on both sides. Here he stuck to the dictum, Pitṛudevo Bhāva. He could have taken the other stand and followed the dictum MātŗDevo Bhāva and disobeyed his father. In both the cases, he would have been a Dharmiṣṭa. Here, we can see that it is one’s own delicate preference which needs to be honoured. There is no running away or escapism or cunningness.

The benefit of understanding the concept of dharma at the fundamental level is to restructure Dharma. If Dharma was an end in itself then there is no salvation. We would all be adharmi-s from that angle. Kālidāsa in his epic poem Raghuvamśa described the four stages of man while referring to the dynasty of Raghu.

**शैशवे अभ्यस्त विद्यानां यौवने विषयैषिणाम् ।**

**वार्धके मुनिवृत्तीनां योगेनान्ते तनुत्यजाम्॥**

**Śaiśavē abhyasta vidyānāṁ yauvanē viṣayaiṣiṇām,**

**vārdhakē muni-vr̥ttīnāṁ yōgēna-antē tanu- tyajām.**

It shows how our ancestors gave importance to the four stages in the evolution of man. The first was the learning age called śaiśava or bālya. Then came the period of youvana of gṛhasta where there was freedom for enjoyment. Then they moved gently away from Bhoga during their old age by leading an ascetic life in the forest called vānaprastha. Finally, it was sanyāsa where even the smallest bhoga was given up to prepare for leaving the body.

There was no absoluteness about these things, as it was a matter of convenience. At respective stages it was possible for people to practice without any difficulty. All these dhārmic values were insisted upon for mental peace. Now, we can have any number of different ways in which the same peace could be cultivated.

Let us take a person who does not do worship of Gods. Is he an adharmi? NO. We have deliberated earlier that all kinds of pūjā-s are neutral activities which help in cleansing of minds. The said person may be practicing prāṇāyāma or meditation. So Dharma has alternatives. So, restructuring of Dharma is possible. Highly traditional people, rooted purely in dos and don’ts of the laws laid down did not understand the scope of dharma.

If the intention of the śāstrā-s were for upliftment of humanity then there are alternatives to the harsh and ungraceful ways practiced hitherto. Hundreds of substitutes are possible. A substitute for sandhya can be japa for longer times. One need not feel sorry that he has given up sandhya, now that he has a better tool with him. The subtler the level of sādhana, the superior you are as a protector of dharma. Whatever takes one to permanent mental peace is Dharma. <u>Please continue the practices with an understanding as to why they are prescribed and not with blind faith.</u>

Now we will analyse the following cases-the affair of Ahalya, Draupadi’s marriage, the cases of Parāśara and Kṛṣṇa where they all deviated from Dharma visibly, explicitly.

Ahalya was cursed with stone hood. Here, we have to take the curse as immobility for the body, with mind being intact. as we know that ātmā cannot die. Being the wife of a Ŗşi, the process of introspection and purification must have started by realising the fault. The period during which she was in stone hood was a period of tapasya for her. The tapasya was to conquer the forces of mind during correction phase. Here, let us understand as to what is pātivratya and why it was prescribed for a woman. Every prescription given either for man or woman is for his/her self control and growth. And pātivratya is one such prescription for woman for her spiritual growth and cittaśuddhi. Through conquering the instincts for sex, one manages cittaśuddhi. In the episode of Ahalya, after going through years of tapasyā of self purification, if she stands unaffected, unperturbed by the best of male beauty, Rāma, standing before her, we can say that she has conquered sex. Thus the intensions of pativratya are restored. Intension of any discipline is to push you up in the ladder of self purification – in this case it is pativratya, or conquest of sex by vicāra.

Draupadi’s case is interesting since she comes to an understanding with her five husbands that every year she will accept only one of them as her husband. The other four will stay as her brothers. If Arjuna is her husband Yudhiṣṭira is treated as her husband’s elder brother and that is all. How is this possible? It is an attitudinal change and is a possibility. In our daily life also, we will be seeing woman staying with her husband in a joint family where other male members of the family are treated as brothers. Every time Draupadi submitted herself to the discipline of staying with one husband only as per pātivratya-dharma. Once the intentions of the discipline are understood and appreciated, anything can be seen in that light.

Parāśara’s case is the most difficult of the three examples. Even an ordinary man can conclude that he has committed the sin by misbehaving with an unmarried girl. Parāśara could not even wait till he met the father of the girl and take his permission for marrying the girl. In spite of this, it is strange that he is called Bhagavān Parāśara! How do we account this absurdity? We have to apply the definition of Dharma in this case as follows - Dharma is one which takes you to mental balance through a series of disciplinary processes. When there is a scope for adharma or temptation, they can be conquered easily. Parāśara had reached the pinnacle of control of mind. Nothing in the world can shake him from that steadfastness. He has completely conquered the temptations. Cittaśuddhi of the highest order has been achieved by him. What is then dharma or adharma for such a person? Normal definitions of dharma do not apply to such people. Such laws are applicable to persons like us who are not completely free from worldly pleasures. So, whatever a sage like Parāśara does is dharma, be it sex or otherwise. Nothing can tilt him. Abstinence from temptations will not add further to his stability. The laws which were till now operative, will not operate on such a person. They are above such laws. They are called Dharmātīta.

Explained in a simple way, there are three major differences in the behaviour of human beings on earth.



1. **Un-ethical is the animal way of behaviour (Immoral).**
2. **Ethical is the natural way of sticking to human values (Moral)**
3. **Freedom from ethical values and dropping them when needed is not unethical, but it is A-ETHICAL or A-MORAL - above and beyond moral values.**

The laws of Dharma do not apply to persons of third category. This freedom from laws of Dharma are applicable to only such persons who have touched the source of creation and who have the capacity to confer boons or even to curse. For them, these laws are childish or elementary. They can take liberties with the laws of nature. This power we could see in Parāśara. He had the extraordinary powers of creation and thus could restore the virginity of Sugandhi. No one should quote Parāśara and take liberties. Parāśara could ward off the guilt sense or impurity sense on the part of Matsyagandhi in a trice.

This is the extra vision and courage of Hinduism which is not found elsewhere in the world. One could go beyond Dharma. This is the region of freedom which a brahmajñāni or Gods have access to. All others stop at the region of Dharma. Why did Parāśara do such an act? To show that such regions of freedom, that of Eshwara, exist. In this context we have a bold śloka in Bhagavad-Gīta (18-17):

**यस्य नाहंकृतो भावो बुद्धिर्यस्य न लिप्यते ।**

**हत्वापि स इमान् लोकान् न हन्ति न निबध्यते॥**

**Yasya na-ahaṁ-kr̥tō bhāvō buddhiḥ-yasya na lipyatē,**

**hatvā-api sa imān lōkān na hanti na nibadhyatē.**

Whoever does it in dispassion, in utter detachment and who is not affected by the event, even if he takes a sword and cuts off the whole mankind, he is not deemed to have killed anybody and the killing does not tarnish him. Another famous śloka from Bhagavad Gīta (2-45)-

**त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा: निस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन ।**

**निर्द्वन्द्वो नित्यसत्वस्थो निर्योगक्षेम आत्मवान्॥**

**Traiguṇya-viṣayā vēdāḥ nistraiguṇyō bhava arjuna,**

**nirdvandvō nitya-satvasthō niryōgakṣēma ātmavān.**

Arjuna, this moral, ethical, etc, are within the regions of Satva, Rajas and Tamas. When one grows beyond the three guṇas, action right or action wrong has no meaning. Then, where is the Dhrama or adharma? That is what a Jñāni is. If application of dharma in the case of sage Parāśara is understood, then all absurdities of Kṛṣṇa are understood.

We have mundane examples also. We also take such short cuts in our life. As a scientist, we do it many times. Take for example of chemistry lab where an examination is going on and if a student makes a mistake of touching a small weight in his hand instead of using the forceps, marks will be deducted for that, as it is against the rules of weighing. Similarly the burette and pipette are to be rinsed before any solution is put in them. This is also a rule and no excuse will be given if someone violated this rule. Whereas, the Professor does not bother about this and easily handles the weights in his bare hands since he knows that, that much degree of accuracy is not needed in a particular test. Why? Because the purpose is served. But, the student is not spared as a matter of discipline. Whoever knows the implications of the law can violate the law without any objection, if the purpose is served.

A lineman of an electricity department handles a live wire with a simple gloves which is not permitted for others. He knows the intensity of electricity flowing through the line. A knowledgeable man who knows the why of a law, can violate the law if the point is served by it.

A simple Bhajan can be irritating for a person who is adopting a different method to calm his mind. Whereas, for the person doing bhajan it is a wonderful sādhana. A spiritual growth like bhajan can be a noise to another person. So, the laws are only conventional.

To summarise, it is important to adopt the principles of prema, tyāga and nigraha, which are the basis of dharma, cautiously after a full understanding of the consequences arising out of such practices and lead a life of complete happiness. This is the avenue open to one and all.
