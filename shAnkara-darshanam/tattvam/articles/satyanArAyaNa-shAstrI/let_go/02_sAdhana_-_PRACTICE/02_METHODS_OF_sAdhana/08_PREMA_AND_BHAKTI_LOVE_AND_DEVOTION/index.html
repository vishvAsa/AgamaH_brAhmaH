  <p>We went through śubha-karmamārga which was very important since we cannot always use -Jñānamārga and Yogamārga. We have to incorporate karmakāṇḍa methods of doing pūja, reciting sahasranāma, etc. as an alternative. Apart from these any karma which is not exciting can be taken up in our daily lives as a portion of our time table wherein the boredom forces can be easily dissolved. One needs to take care that the activities so taken up should not raise kāma and krodha. Number of such tricks are available and one can use them just to spend the time and energy. Forget that some God gives you benefit. It is the śubhakarma which will keep you in a peaceful mode. Unknowingly you are in a soft state of mind during those hours. You are nearer to brahmasthiti. What was left over in our study was another method which is called <strong>Bhaktimārga- भक्तिमार्ग</strong>, <strong>or Prēmamārga- प्रेममार्ग</strong>.</p>
<p>Prēma is a very soft state of mind compared to our several other states of mind. This is called ADŪRAKEVALĪBHĀVA- an inch removed from the peaceful state or the state of self. In contrast with violent states like anger, jealousy, etc., this is a very soft state. That is why parampara called it adūra- not removed- near to peaceful state. If a sādhaka were to stay in this soft state for longer duration, he will gently slip into that brahmasthiti which is the goal of every person.</p>
<p>It is difficult to describe that state! It is as good as someone trying to describe the sweetness of sugar. The only way of understanding that state is to get into it and feel that state. We have many occasions in our daily life to get into this state, as every one of us is equipped with that prēmabhāva.</p>
<p>The husband has returned from a tedious office job in the evening and his wife rushes to him with all smiles with a cup of coffee. The state of that woman then is called prēmasthiti.</p>
<p>When any one of you are walking on a street and see a small boy fall from bicycle and hurts himself you at once run to him and lift him with soothing words. You are in the prēmasthiti. On all such occasions we are in prēmabhāva.</p>
<p>Prēma is a natural state in every one of us**. Prēma goes with tyāga and they are inseparable constituents.** Love and sacrifice go together. If we can get it in amplified state then it becomes prēma-utkarshasthiti. That is what we see in Sri Rāmakṛṣṇa. This is called prēma-bhakti. Whatever softness we try to achieve over years of tapas, can be got in ten minutes through prēmabhāva.</p>
<p>While taming of mind being so difficult, one stroke of prēma can put you into soft state. Both the comforter and the comforted are in a diffused state of mind. We will take one or two examples from Mythology to see how the whole thing fits in.</p>
<p>It is a story from Rāmāyaṇa. We have seen in the anecdote of Bharata and Rāma, how Rāma sacrificed the throne to fulfil his father’s wishes while Bharata rejected the throne got by her mother’s wishes. Here prēma goes with tyāga. When Bharata goes to Rāma and tells him that the foolishness of his mother cannot be supportedand begs Rāma to come back and take charge, Rāma declines the offer and insists that Bharata should return and rule the kingdom. Bharata requests for his pādukā-s and keeps them on the throne and rules as a proxy.</p>
<p>Another episode is the situation when Rāma is returning after fourteen years of exile in the forest. He is in Bharadwāja āshrama. Rāma gets a feeling that Bharata may be interested in ruling the kingdom, in which case he was ready to relinquish it for his brother’s sake. He instructs Hanumān to ascertain from Bharata if he still wanted to be the king. What a tyāga on the part of Rāma for the sake of happiness of his brother.</p>
<p>On the other hand, study the case of Bharata. He did not have iota of displeasure on Rāma’s return. In fact, he was eagerly awaiting his arrival. Here we see that the sacrifice of Bharata is of a much higher order than that of Rāma. Rāma thought that Bharata would be on the throne clad gorgeously and having looks of a King. But, we find Bharata in a ṛṣi’s attire, living in the parṇakutira (a thatched hut) forty miles away from Ayodhya along with āśrama inmates. He was with knotted hair, emaciated by the separation from his brother, eating only fruits available in the forest and looking virtually like a tapasvi. With utter self control, he was ruling the kingdom typically as a trustee. Bharata is so excited to hear the news of Rāma returning andgets ready to serve his brother after handing over the kingdom. This is an instance of prēma and tyāga reaching the exalted state.</p>
<p>The next situation in Rāmāyaṇa is Rāmā’s coronation ceremony where, after the event, gifts are to be given. The gifting ceremony is going on and the respected dignitaries are presenting themselves before Rāma. The last person in the line is Hanumantha. Rāma is at a loss as to what gift he should give him. Hanumantha was everything to him and he cannot equate any commodity to the love and service of Hanumān. The series of events that took place in Rāmyaṇa was because of him. It was impossible for Rāma to decide what gift he could give him when he was with him although. He decides that the best thing that he can give is a warm hug and so he gets down from the throne and hugs him with tears rolling down his cheeks. In turn, Hanumān says that his life has become worthwhile. Both are charged with emotion with the sense of gratitude and sense of fulfilment. That is the state of ecstasy and is the culmination in prēmabhāva.</p>
<p>Another example we can take from Mahābhārata- the case of Draupadi who is a famous mythological character and who thrived by Prēma and Bhakti. In the cases of Dūrvāsa ātithya, the Vastrāpaharaņa and restoration episode in the court of king Dṛtarāṣṭra, etc, Kṛṣṇa assures her every time and her wishes are fulfilled. God comes to the rescue of bhakta whenever the devotee is in an exalted state of prēma and bhakti. He goes to the level of bhakta and helps him. He did not preach Vedānta at that time. Here, we should see the subtle difference between the two. Prēma has a touch of intimacy. In Bhakti the familiarity is replaced by reverence. Both are soft states but Bhakti carries an aspect of reverence.</p>
<p><strong>While prēma goes with tyāga, Bhakti goes with reverence, submission and surrender.</strong></p>
<p>In arpaṇābhāva, ego is dropped. When you go to the Divine as a bhakta, a wonderful mechanism is operating there. You are surrendering to HIM without any scheming or planning. Aham and mama (me and mine) are both gone. Quietening of mind happens instantaneously. Even a hard core scientific person becomes soft in this mood. Whenever you touch the feet of an elder person you get into that soft state. This is the beauty of Bhakti.</p>
<p>Triputināśa happens for a Jñāni by vairāgya. For a bhakta, the same thing happens by a simple surrender. Both of them reach that state which is the abode of peace.</p>
<p>So to conclude, Prēma and Bhakti are the best tools in the hands of man to attain the brahma- bhāvana. All other methods require effort and discipline to attain the same state. One of the best methods of sādhana is the Prēmayoga or the Bhaktiyoga. One has to get convincedabout the importance and then it is easy to attain the state.</p>
<p>**Q.**Prēmabhāva with God is alright. But, when you extend this to our own family members like wife, brother, sister and children, due to our vāsanā-s we don’t get that reverence or the poojyabhāva. A sort of bondage or attachment is created which is an impediment to our goal of vairāgya. How to break this and get away from that likely bondage?</p>
<p>**A.**It is a very good question. We have to forget the attachment or moha component here. In most of the cases, prēma supersedes the moha element. The contentment that mother and the son get between them masks the moha aspect. This in turn gives a spiritual lift. The special interest we take in our kith and kin is a negative part of the whole story, whereas we have to see only the upliftment part in prēmabhāva. One has to be a conscious sādhaka and should not get involved in moha. Only then it becomes universal, even among family members:</p>
<p><strong>सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु मा कश्चित् दुःखभाग्भवेत् ॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sarvē bhavantu sukhinaḥ sarvē santu nirāmayāḥ,</strong></p>
<p><strong>sarvē bhadrāṇi paśyantu mā kaścit duḥkhabhāgbhavēt.</strong></p>
<p>May all be happy.</p>
<p>May all be free from disabilities.</p>
<p>May all see the good in others.</p>
<p>May none suffer from sorrow.</p>
<p>Then, the above concept begins to set in the mind. In the whole process, ego should vanish and that is the main concern for the sādhaka. You should understand that when the mind becomes empty at that moment of prēmabhāva, where is the question of moha?</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> The ecstasy developed through prēma can cause a lot of mental damage. How do we rate this?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. There is certainly an element of torment, no doubt. This is because of the excitement element without which one may not get the adūrakevalībhāva.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. But most of the bhaktā-s turn hysterical?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The deep involvement in the bhajan and the dance puts them into deep levels of emptiness because of the huge energy expenditure. There is gentle load on the system which makes them go out of tune. But, that is only momentary. After years of training when mahāshānti sets in, this also will crumble down. Forgiving becomes natural and one does not have any enemies in the world. Fault finding stops for such a person.</p>
<p>In Nārada Bhakti Sūtra, there is a definition of prēma which can be easily distinguished from kāma-<strong>tat sukha sukhitvaṁ- तत् सुख सुखित्वम् - Gopikā prēmavat, rādhāprēmavat- गोपिकाप्रेमवत्, राधा प्रेमवत्</strong>. What is so special about Rādhā or Gopikā-s when they loved Kṛṣṇa? When they loved him it was for his joy and not for their personal joy. It was for the comfort of Kṛṣṇa and not for their comfort. Rukmiṇi&rsquo;s prēma and Satyabhāmā&rsquo;s prēma are gently different. Satyabhāma wanted Kṛṣṇa to alleviate her boredom and bring in contentment. Kṛṣṇa was for her joy. Whereas, Rukmiṇi found comfort in attending to Kṛṣṇa and making him happy.</p>
<p>The gains of doing ten days of tapas can be had by one stroke of surrender. You must watch a simple housewife. How she surrenders to the Lord saying that she is helpless and unable to solve the problems. She says that she is too small to do tapas and difficult sādhana. She can only surrender and get mentally assured that Lord will take care of her&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>अन्यथा शरणं नास्ति त्वमेव शरणं मम ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>तस्मात् कारुण्यभावेन रक्ष रक्ष जनार्दन ॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyathā śaraṇaṁ na-asti tvam-ēva śaraṇaṁ mama,</strong></p>
<p><strong>tasmāt kāruṇya-bhāvēna rakṣa rakṣa janārdana.</strong></p>
<p>I have no other refuge, Thou art my sole refuge,Out of sense of compassion, protect me, O Supreme Lord!</p>
<p>This is called <strong>Śaraṇāgatibhāva, शरणागतिभाव -</strong>, or <strong>prapattibhāva- प्रपत्तिभाव or arpaṇabhāva-</strong>. In a minute the ego is destroyed and the mind surrenders. This is a very quick method which we cannot underscore. In a stroke it can bring down the citta to zero level. A house wife can be very much successful in Bhakti and surrender.</p>
<p>I did all this detailed study in order to drive home the point in you that our forefathers had such excellent lofty ideas and ideals. We should wonder at the skill of the vedāntic Indian researcher in formulating this wide range of sādhanā-s. After this research, all my questions were solved.</p>
<p>That is why one cannot say which sādhaka is at a higher level and which sādhaka is at lower level. That is in bad taste. Whosoever works, with whatsoever tasks, is a noble soul and we should offer our prostrations to him. Any school of thought for that matter has to be accommodated. Even the crudest way of pūja when I see, I feel wonderful in my heart and I get into a trance. Do not decry the simple austerity measure under taken by the women in the house, like fasting in the night for satisfying the pūja requirements. Do not laugh at her daily bhajans or śloka chanting. You dare not make a word of censure there. You may do things different from her methods, like prāṇāyāma, āsana, etc. Every method is holy by itself.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> When you are referring different methods of sādhana, you mentioned that it is slow and takes time to achieve. But how do you say that surrender brings in instant results? If that is so, then why people ignored this method?</p>
<p>**A.**The surrender is one of the tools to empty the mind because one completely negates one’s role. In the process, reduces his ego to such a level that the mind becomes empty, thus putting one in peace. But this also is not an easy method. It requires a <strong>lot of courage and conviction</strong>to do this. The immense faith in the Almighty that he would solve the problem, cannot come all of a sudden.</p>
<p>But the one good thing is that ego is almost killed in this process very fast. In other methods, we are taming the forces by bringing down focussing and speed. This also is time dependant, as de conditioning is not instantaneous.</p>
<p>In other methods, ‘I’ has to be removed consciously. Whereas, in surrender the &lsquo;I&rsquo; is easily done away by asserting that you do not have a role and leave it to the Almighty to take care of things. The Jñānamārga may suit one. The Yogamārga may suit another. Karma Yoga may look easy for some. Samarpaṇabhāva or Bhakthimārga may be easy for some other. So, each one has to do some introspection and take to what is best for him and remain steady in that practice with all humility and conviction that the path chosen will certainly lead to the goal. After all, we are doing all this to achieve inner peace.</p>
<p>You should know that there are two &lsquo;I&rsquo;s. One is the thinking &lsquo;I&rsquo; and the other is an emotionally caught &lsquo;I&rsquo; or the focusing &lsquo;I&rsquo;. Vega and focussing were the burdens in which my &lsquo;I&rsquo; was resting. When the attentive &lsquo;I&rsquo; goes, what is the residue? In what form can this &lsquo;I&rsquo; stay? This is the last lakṣaṇa of the &lsquo;I&quot;, the thinking &lsquo;I&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Show me an &lsquo;I&rsquo; beyond that. Ahaṁkāra is not vanity. It means that I am a doer. The doer at the cittasthāna is the thinker. Thinker or the thinking is the last lakṣaṇa of the vulnerable &lsquo;I&rsquo; or the suffering &lsquo;I&rsquo;. When that goes where is the &lsquo;I&rsquo;? It is an expansion-brahmasvarūpa. Inśaraṇāgati, you surrender yourself. That means you surrender thinking or the thinking &lsquo;I&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But, when you are looking at the process of surrender, you are still in the ego state. The observer also has to be surrendered. It is easy to surrender bhoga and other things. But, one has to surrender the mischief maker, lingering fellow, i.e., the observer. That is why samarpaṇa method becomes easier than other methods, only when you understand the mechanism. In other methods you kill the &lsquo;I&rsquo; by not doing, not thinking, and not getting excited and this is a matter of time and effort.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Sir how do the pursuits and goals that one has set up fit into vedāntic pursuit of happiness?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> That’s a very good question and a very contextual question. What else can be a goal of man? It ought to be one’s happiness or the happiness ofone’s near and dear? If you are more liberal it can be the happiness of the globe. **Sarvē bhavantu sukhinaḥ -**सर्वॆ भवन्तु सुक्खिन:. Let all beings be happy throughout this Universe.Every pursuit of man, trivial or profound, is in the direction of happiness. At the smallest level, it is indriyabhoga. At the next level, it is the joy of achievement. At a still higher level, it is the joy of service, giving something worthwhile to the society at large. Everything becomes Joy, comfort, ānanda. Why does one serve staying by the side of a sick patient spending six hours of the night? It is to get the joy of comforting the sick. Don’t you think that this joy is superior to others? Nonetheless it is the joy of comforting a human, the sick person. Everywhere the ultimate motivation is ānanda and sukha.</p>
<p>Thank you, one and all, for staying with me and sharing my thoughtsall these days and I hope that all of you attain inner peace, which is the only thing to be attained in this world. Benefit by the vedāntic truths and lead a happy life as Upaniṣad-s proudly announce:</p>
<p><strong>जीवेम शरदश्शतम्।</strong></p>
<p><strong>नन्दाम शरदश्शतम्।</strong></p>
<p><strong>मोदाम शरदश्शतम्॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jīvēma śaradaśśatam,                                               Nandāma śaradaśśatam,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mōdāma śaradaśśatam.</strong></p>
