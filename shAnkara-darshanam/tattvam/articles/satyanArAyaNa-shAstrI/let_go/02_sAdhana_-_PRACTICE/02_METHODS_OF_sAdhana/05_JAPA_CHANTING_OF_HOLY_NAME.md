title = "05 JAPA (CHANTING OF HOLY NAME)"

+++

Till now we looked at the optical centre- a picture. The next centre is the **Śabdasthāna** or sound as a medium.

When you come down to the śabdasthāna, the same principle has to work that the bothering energy must be spent away and during that process mind is not excited. The prescription given under this centre is called **JAPA.** Continuous repetition of God’s name or a Mantra or a chosen word introduced at this centre is termed as japa

This is the one tool that every teacher recommends. Every religious school does prescribe japa. The internal process involved during japa is expending the bothering energy thereby resulting in the mind becoming calm. The teacher would ask the disciple to have a name as japa during meditation practice. The reason for prescribing japa was that it would make meditation easy. Incidentally the recitation process drew all the excess energy creating relaxation.

Japa is an activity at the throat centre where sounds originate and this results in spending away most of the energy. This is at a place lower to the mind centre. Much of the prāṇic energy that is coming to the mind centre is spent away at the throat centre itself. Thus, much less energy reaches the ājñā centre (Cittasthāna) resulting in expansion. That is all the science involved. There is no religious dogma here but all religions have incorporated this part of science.

Frequently asked questions on the practice of japa.

**Q.** Should the japa be long or should it be a short one?

**A.** In the beginning, use a longer phrase. It will yield better results. That was why Gāyatri mantra was prescribed at the beginning. More energy is required in chanting this long mantra. So, feeding of energy to a higher centre is reduced and expansion process starts. The chanting is the programme and expansion is the gain. Japa by itself is not important, but the resulting expansive state is important.

**Q.** Should it be recited loud or mentally?

**A.** In the beginning both can happen. After sometime it is better to do the japa mentally. This development will automatically come when you are steadfast in sādhana.

**Q**. Should the recitation of japa be fast or slow?

**A.** The system takes care of that one. When a sādhaka is disturbed due to circumstances, then automatically the chanting becomes faster. The system manages the speed of the japa. That is the natural law there. After ten minutes or so, when some energy is spent away, the system restoration takes place and japa goes on at the required pace.

**Q.** Should it be mono-syllable or multi-syllable?

**A.** To start with multi syllable is better than OM, till the attention improves.

**Q.** Should it be taken from a Guru or can one recite without the initiation from the Guru?

**A.** If you have the conviction about the mechanism, there is no need of any Guru. If you have a sense of guilt, then go to a teacher, pay his dakṣiṇa or fees and get it from him. That may give you the necessary devotion. Use your own discretion here. I did not take to any Guru, whereas my wife went to a guru! The main purpose of this initiation is to see that you do the japa regularly and not give up and to overcome a feeling of guilt or lack of devotion. Whatever be the programme, it is the result that is more important. Please remove the fear factor that God will punish you if you were to err in your religious practices. God is highly benevolent and helpful.

**Q.** Should the japa be done only in God’s room?

**A.** Please do it if you can, but it is not necessary. You can choose any place which should be disturbance free till you attain a level of sādhana. As you progress in the path, any amount of noise or disturbance or lack of cleanliness does not bother you. It is good to be disciplined in the beginning, to make sure you are installed in the practice of regular japa. Please remember that japa is only a tool and this is also not needed after you strengthen your conviction. If thoughts can be replaced by this pure word, where can rāga, dveṣa, kāma and krodha arise? Mundane thoughts must be replaced by japa, is the intention.

A lady came to me one day and said that she took my word in letter and spirit and started the recitation. Mental chanting had become so natural that she was unable to stop the japa even when she was in the toilet. This was her worry, whether it was a right thing. How blessed she was compared to any one of us, as her whole life has become japamātrā! This can happen to one in a million. I had to assure the lady that she is blessed so much and asked her to continue the same.

**Q**. I do not believe in God’s names at all and what other mantra should I use?

**A**. You can use any word for japa as long as it does not give harmful thoughts. Look at the science behind. There is no religion here. A portion of that bothering energy is to be spent in a pious way or in an unexciting way. That is all what is needed. That’s why I termed it as mechanical activity or meaningless activity. The rule to be served is that excitement must not be there in citta. Actually there is no religious sacredness here. If you could have sacredness, it could be an added point.

**Q.** Are you prescribing this for everybody? For example even for those people who say that there is no need to go to the temples or for those who say that they can see God within themselves?

**A.** In that case there should be some other mode of expenditure through any other neutral activity. Many people do not believe in going to temples. But there is nothing wrong in it. You have the alternatives like mechanical activity, repetitive activity-meaningless activity. It is like the same biblical saying asking one to count up to ten slowly- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10- when you are angry. While doing that, the bulk of the energy is spent away which would have otherwise given rise to anger and the reaction thereof. This is the remarkable vision of the rishis.

When you are placed in helpless situation take to some type of japa. It is a mahāsādhana as all mundane forces are dissolved. Forces like speed and focusing get dropped and mind starts dying.

Japa starts decomposing itself when you know that slowing has to be practiced and whatever japa that is being uttered reduces to Omkāra.

Shri Rāmakṛṣṇa has rightly said that sandhyāvandana merges into mere GAYATRI JAPA. Gayatri japa merges into OM and OM when stretched, merges into silence and that is svarūpa. Mānḍūkya Upaniṣad puts this as- amātraḥ Caturthaḥ pādaḥ-there is no activity or vyāpāra at all when silence sets in. 

**Q.** What about mukti?

**A.** The point of importance is that we have reversed the direction. Bhagavad-Ġīta states:

**अनेकजन्म संसिद्धः ततो याति परां गतिम् ।**

**Anēka-janma saṁsiddhaḥ tatō yāti parāṁ gatim.**(6-45)

After many lives of vāsanākṣaya, purification starts and one attains the end point.

**बहूनाम् जन्मनामन्ते ज्ञानवान् माम् प्रपद्यते ।**

**Bahūnām janmanām antē jñānavān mām prapadyatē.**(7-19)

Even a Jñāni gets liberation after many many lives. That is the true position. We cannot underwrite that sādhana phase. But siddhānta is the base for sādhana; otherwiseyou have no base at all!

**Q.** If many more janmās are required for our liberation, in what way we are better than others?

**A.** We are better because we know things now about the process to become better human beings. Others may take twenty thousand lives without any improvement because they have no ways tosee the difference. In fact one is spoiling oneself by getting more angry, more jealous and craving to get more and more material things. Once you get this Jñāna, craving for things gets controlled and there is a big shift in the process of evolution. How long it takes should not be a matter of concern or a point to be bothered about.**Our happiness today is better than that of yesterday. A week after it will be still better is the point to be appreciated.**

I could not continuously sit for a few minutes without any work at one point of time, but now, once I started this sādhana, I really enjoy sitting without any prop. I was getting worked up in ten minutes then but I can now sit comfortably for four hours over a period of sādhana. That means, it is possible to stay diffused once you are in the path of sādhana.

One load of kāma or desire lessened or one load of anger decreased, results in aton of joy. That is a fact. But, whatever practice we adopt we should have the following in our mind: The elements of Naidhānya (slowing down) and Vistārata (defocusing) are to be brought in. Hurry and anxiety are to be totally avoided. <u>All our discussion and the various methods indicated mainly refer to MENTAL LEVEL</u>. Do not draw lines of demarcation between various types of sādhana-s. Each method iscomplementary and supplementary to others. Do not sit in watertight compartments. BECOME A REAL SĀDHAKA. The forces are so severe that we cannot tackle the entire stock by simply sitting. This stock of force is too big to manage and this is our problem. That is why both yogamārga and Jñānamārga fail.

**Q.** Is it not a fact that activity gives joy? If not, then what else?

**A.** The proof is very simple. Sit in the house without doing anything. That is the biggest test, to check whether you are growing in the vedāntic way or not. No wife to talk to. No kitchen where you can go and get some snacks. No music to listen to. Everybody in the world fails. Why?

This is the explanation. Continuously energy is being released. Fortunately for man, as quickly as it is released, he is expending it. The child cries away its energy. The fool talks away his energy. Man walks away his energy. A clever man thinks away his energy and therefore he is comfortable. He is spending in ever so many ways that the system becomes relaxed and therefore he is comfortable. And he gives credit to KARMA OR ACTIVITY, saying that Karma gave him joy. Spending of the energy is the only means by which you are becoming empty at the sūkṣmasthāna resulting in a no mind state. That’s givingyou joy.

This is the way we are all happy. Karma is a means of expenditure of this unbearable energy. Once that is spent away, you are in the non-doing phase. You are in Amanībhāva, i.e. you reach the no-mind state. No-activity-state is the point of joy. Whereas our notion is 'karma gave us joy', 'bhoga gave me joy'. This is ignorance.

So the advice is not to hold the huge amount of these energy forces. That is why Karmakāṇḍa in Hindu tradition is highly placed. Śankara justifies this as it leads to cittaśuddhi.

Tradition gives you a simpler method. What is this principle? Don’t hold the forces. You will injure your system and the sādhana fails. Instead of becoming softer you become irritable. For many it has happened. Sampradāya says that one should not take up sanyāsa unless he or she is fit for that. It is good togo on with one's gṛhastha āsṛama. Do not deny the ānanda that life gives you and try by getting into a harder way. There is a simpler way

**Q** Whenever we practice these neutral activities, we are likely to step into acts of indifference or tamas. Don’t you think one has to be very careful while applying this method?

**A.** Whether it is indifference or lack of application is a matter of judgement. My answer to that question is- you can be dishonest to others and pretend. But you cannot be dishonest to yourself. If you want the fruits of the action, you should not act with laziness as it amounts to casual approach. One need not run away from profession in the name of Vedānta but carry on the duties removing the hurry element. Then you are growing in respect of peace. We are prone to become indifferent in the name of vairāgya. So we have to judge ourselves carefully.

**Q.**How do you really know if tamas gave you comfort or the sādhana?

**A.** Tamas gives comfort, but tamas is not lifting. We must come out of tamas and get into satva. These śubhakarmā-sare such that they remove the tamas. Along with the removal of rāga, dveṣa, they also remove the tamas. The japa, sahasranāma, aşţottara paṭhana, formal pūja, abhisheka, śodaśa pūja- all that keeps you awake and combat the tamas.

**Q** As per your earlier statement, I am more relaxed when I am in tamas. What you mean by this?

**A.**We can take the three phases of liquid as an example. Ice is a condensed formand is confinement representing Tamas. When it becomes liquid, mobility has already set in and this state represents Rajas. When the kinetic energy remarkably increases then it gets the form of water vapour which is expansive and this state represents Satva. When the vapour molecule ruptures then that results in vyāpakatvaor anantatā.

Pṛthvi becomes āpa, āpa becomes vāyu and vāyu becomes ākāśa. Then it is pure self.

When any matter annihilates it gives out tremendous energy and when that energy spreads away it gives you silence.

I would like to repeat an excellent definition given by one of you the other day on sattva, rajas and tamas. Coming to human mind:

Desiring without actingis – **Tamas.**

Desiring with acting is ------ **Rajas.**

No desiring and acting is--- **Sattva.**

No desire and no activity is -**Turīya.**

**Q.** I had a similar difficulty. I do sahasranāma with whatever zeal I have. But somewhere in the corner of mind, I am being told that yogamārga is better for me. How will I know which mārga is good for me?

**A**. That is a good question. One has to decide for himself. For example I spend most of the time in solitude. Someone else may spend his time in work. You have to be careful not to get succumbed to sleep. You have to be alert and wakeful. Ultimately sādhakā has to tread the path carefully.

**Q.** Is it good to continue the same sādhana if it gives you happiness?

**A**. That is one good yardstick (mānadanḍa). The other test is to check whether peace and happiness have increased or not. If you are doing your sahasranāma, energy expenditure takes place and you are happy. But, is it also giving you progress in sādhana is an important point you have to test. The test is, when you sit quiet, you must be more comfortable and not pressured. Then the sādhanā-s are working. Ultimate test is –one should be comfortable without any prop what so ever. This is a very delicate question one should examine and the good point is -you should err on the safer side. Therefore do karma, instead of prematurely sitting and getting in to tamas even without your knowledge.
