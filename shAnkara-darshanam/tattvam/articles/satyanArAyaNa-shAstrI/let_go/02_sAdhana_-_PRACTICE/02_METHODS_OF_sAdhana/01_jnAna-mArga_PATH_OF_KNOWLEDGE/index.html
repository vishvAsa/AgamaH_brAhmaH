  <p>Jñanamarga, as Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa’s definition goes, is<strong>samyak avekṣaṇam-</strong> whatever wrong notions we have, about the nature of sukha and about our own nature, we correct them by right ideas. This is the safest method and is most productive. A sick person can do that, a paralytic patient can do that, a woman with a child can do that, a suckling mother can do that, a boy can do that because there is no toil in this process and there is no struggle. By simple suggestions, one can counter duḥkha.</p>
<p>By correct counselling, by auto suggestions, one can achieve the desired results. Therefore it is the easiest, safest but most productive. When the mind slips into disturbance, advise the mind to become quiet. You can do that when you are in a train; you can do that when you are driving, you can do that when you are in the office. When you get a stroke of annoyance tell yourself that annoyance is not necessary and is not your true nature.</p>
<p>Our system is equipped with these two tools. By a long practice of suggestion, one removes the forces inside and by applying the principle of LET GO one is able to conquer the mind.Our system can change under the influence of suggestions. Whenever there is duḥkha in the form of speed, suggest to slowdown. Whenever there is increased focussing, suggest the system to undo the pressure built up at the ājñācakra by suggesting ‘let go’.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with the speed in your profession, continue the same as long it is not burdensome to you. When the system complains, start using the method since it works wonderfully. Always remember the triple gems as we call them- <strong>śravaṇa, Manana and Nididhyāsa</strong> -**श्रवण, मनन, निदिधयास -**Śravaṇa is listening and forming a base thought. Manana is that where all secondary questions are sorted out. Nididhyāsa is the one where the process of softening, which has already begun due to sravaṇa and manana, culminates in the peaceful state.</p>
<p>Let us recollect briefly the discussion on sukha- duḥkha parīkṣa which will be relevant to sādhana. What is duḥkha per se? What is sukha per se? It is a few minutes of study for a bright mind. Plenty of sukha moments are there, plenty of duḥkha moments are there for us to study. One’s daughter has not returned home although it is quite late in the night, she may be in trouble and without help, resulting in anxiety, fear, uncertainty. Any duḥkha moment boils down to one thing and that is speed.</p>
<p>Another aspect of duḥkha is to get caught in a point. You try to solve a problem, you don’t get it, and you are in a confined state. In two universities your son has got admission. You start thinking as to which one is better? This gives rise to focussing, minding. This also causes duḥkha. We don’t see the wrong side of focussing, fortunately, because we more often focus and let go. I said there is a safety mechanism by which we let go the state of focussing automatically within a short time. Then we are safe. We don’t complain about focussing. You see the evil of focussing when it is overdone. Suppose you have a problem for which there is no remedy, you keep on focussing in its full version, its exaggerated version. Then there is a breakdown. All our mundane problems, all our professional problems are solved with the tool called focussing, concentration, ekāgrata_,_ one-pointedness. Research is possible because of focussing. There is no second say about it. But then, look at the other side of focussing and what problems it creates, says the śāstra.</p>
<p>That’s why at the first level of listening, we shouldn’t drop focussing abruptly. Understand that you are still in the performance stage. Start practicing Vedānta in the approximate way-strike a compromise. Do the focussing leisurely. Focussing is acceptable if slowness is tagged on to it. Focussing is burdensome when speedily done. Use your intelligence when performance is a must. You are not in a stage where you give up the worldly activities. You want the gains from the world. There is nothing wrong in going after mundane type of sukha. Vedānta is not preaching asceticism, remember that. On the other hand vedānta makes you fit for action when it is required. Arjuna did not run away after listening to Kṛṣṇa after all the preaching in the battlefield. He declared:-</p>
<p><strong>नष्टो मोहः स्मृतिर्लब्ध्वा त्वत्प्रसादान्मयाच्युत ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>स्थितोस्मि गतसंदेहः करिष्ये वचनं तव ॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Naṣṭō mōhaḥ smr̥tiḥ-labdhvā tvat-prasādāt- mayā-acyuta,</strong></p>
<p><strong>sthitaḥ-asmi gata saṁdēhaḥ kariṣyē vacanaṁ tava.</strong> (Bhagavad-Ġīta, 18-73)</p>
<p>My confidence is restored. My scruples are gone. My fears are gone. I can enter into the battlefield of life more effectively.</p>
<p>Therefore, one has to tag on to slowness when ekāgrata is a must, when performance is a must. The burden of focussing is reduced very much at that point. That’s the skill. And when speed is required, be in the expansive state. Or when you are expansive, speed does not become a point for complaint.</p>
<p>You know, when a cricket match is going on and when your side is scoring runs, you will be shouting. You will be up on your seat. But it is not taxing as you are in an expansive mood. If an athlete focuses totally on the thread line he has to reach, that builds up pressure and he will break down. Instead, if he keeps his mind relaxed his performance gets enhanced. <strong>So any amount of focussing is acceptable for the system in the background of slowness and vice versa</strong>.</p>
<p>I would always do that. My son and I would try to solve the chemistry problems of our industry. I could hold on for a couple of hours, whereas he would be tired after one hour. He may be cleverer than me. But then I could hold on, because I go about the whole thing slowly whereas he is too fast or in confusion. Vedānta gives you tricks to become a better performer in your profession, may be medicine, may be engineering, may be teaching. If you apply that in your research work, qualitatively and quantitatively, your research will be of a higher order. Number of papers produced and the quality of papers will be decidedly superior. So, by understanding these points you should not be giving up focussing. Bhagavad-Ġīta puts this very nicely-<strong>Yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam- योगः कर्मसु कौशलम्</strong>. It is a cleverness with which we have to approach the whole problem.</p>
<p><strong>Here there is a question whether all these things are in one’s hands?</strong></p>
<p>The śāstra at once shows that it is certainly in one&rsquo;s hands. Everybody always feels that there is suffering because things around him are bad- boss is bad, child is bad, wife is bad, house is leaking etc-This is met wonderfully when śāstra says one has a<strong>freedom</strong>of operation and is not bound by circumstances. One does not have to bend down to the circumstances that make one so helpless. Śankarā’s enormous faith-</p>
<p><strong>कर्तुं अकर्तुं अन्यथा वा कर्तुं शक्यम्।</strong>(Śankarabhāṣya)</p>
<p><strong>Kartuṁ akartuṁ anyathā vā kartuṁ śakyam.</strong></p>
<p>Man is an extra ordinary species in the universe, unlike inanimate objects which do not have this freedom of decision. He has the ability to do what he feels is right. For example- he can sit or refuse to sit; he can talk or keep quiet- he has the operational freedom even to think or not to think. For the first time, in the evolution process, one sees the freedom element available only in man. So, one has to use this freedom diligently to attain peace. This point must be remembered or must be appreciated for his growth to be possible, for peace to increase. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa explains clearly as to what is mind-</p>
<p><strong>स्वयमेव पीनताम् याति स्वयमेव तानवं याति ।</strong></p>
<p><strong><del>वा</del> स्वयमेव प्रसरते स्वयमेव सङ्कोचमेति च ॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Svayam-ēva pīnatām yāti svayam-ēva tānavaṁ yāti.</strong></p>
<p><strong><del>vā</del> svayam-ēva prasaratē svayam-ēva saṅkōcamēti ca.</strong> (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa. 6-9-19)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unusual species in the universe. It can magnify itself. It can quieten itself. It is not dictated by an external agency. All these years, you were under the belief that your psychological transactions were completely governed by stimulus response theory. Even psychology and psychiatry, nearly stayed by this notion, determinism**. Kārya-kāraṇa-sambandha- कार्यकारणसंबंध** - cause&ndash;result sequence. An abuse on me, I am disturbed. Praise on me, I am comfortable.</p>
<p>No, says śāstra. This is a vulnerable law as far as psychological transactions are concerned. It is true with physical laws. An apple when ripe, pulled by the force of gravity, has got to fall down. Not so with us. We can refuse to be affected internally by the outside world, is the key point in Vedānta. Nothing can touch us- a death, a sorrow, a failure, lack of recognition in society, ill health - major factors of discomfort need not just touch us. <strong>Cidānanda-rūpaḥ śivohaṁ śivohaṁ- चिदानंदरूपः शिवोहम् शिवोहम्</strong> -I am pure, I am auspicious, I am chinmātra, I am mere consciousness, untouched by situations- this is our brahmadharma_,_ and this is our ātmadharma. In fact, if you want me to define brahmadharma or ātmadharma –It is a state of inside which is not touched by anything in the world. You don’t know how profitable it would be when we apply it. It has a solution to all your problems, a subjective solution and therefore permanent. Other solutions are external, objective, and segmental. This is total, subjective, therefore fully in your control. Just use it. You are liberated. The beauty of Vedānta lies in its application. Six months you try this, you are a different person.</p>
<p>My friend, who is a post doctoral fellow, professor in the Institute in Bangalore, was a highly irritable person although he was a very talented person, a rank holder all his career. He used to get upset even for very silly things outside his domain and would lose control on him and would put himself in a miserable plight. Once he listened and appreciated the simple logic put forth by me and he at once shifted his focus and set himself right. He took the situation with utter calmness. He told me that. ‘Shastriji, I applied your method and it worked wonderfully’. That’s Vedānta. Vedānta is extraordinary because it is so convincing and logical.</p>
<p>Take for example the yogāsana posture -ardhamatysendrāsana- it did not defeat your forces of pressure in you. But, only LOGIC defeated your forces. A single correct logic is equal to hundred practices, equal to one thousand pūjā-s. Because, pūja is a mechanical activity. During the pūja time you are comfortable. Outside the pūja time, you have every reason to be fretting and fuming, to be upset. Therefore how can pūja help you? Pūja is wonderful. During the pūja hours there is piety, sacredness, a sense of purity, and you are quiet and fine. But your notion that one must get upset at every wrong situation has not changed. You see the difference. You see the dichotomy. A very religious person is relaxed and is calm during the religious hours. After the religious hours, he thinks he has every reason to get disturbed, to get angry. He spends lot of money to perform a religious function for some benefits and then blames that pūja did not give the results. How can ritualistic religion remove the problems related to wrong notions?</p>
<p>Let us take up righteous indignation! There is no argument in the world to drop righteous indignation. But, here is an argument in vedānta. Righteous indignation is anger which is reasonable. One has made a mistake and therefore I have a right to get annoyed and to scold him. Given the fact that one is unreasonable, why at all it should upset me? This is an argument known only in Vedānta. You should appreciate that. One is so structured that nothing can touch him. He is the master of his ceremonies. One’s mental state is very much in one’s hands. If you can ruminate on this and get convinced your life changes and this is all vedānta. With this knowledge you simply slide into immeasurable levels of peace and calmness and this is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>One needs to start contemplating with oneself thus - I sit and I am disturbed. Why should thoughts come at all? I have the freedom to think or not to think. At every point I have freedom.The thoughts having come, why should they emotionally affect me? When you let the forces go, simply peace sets in. These are the two arguments to increase your peace.</p>
<p>I can illustrate many moments when we are disturbed. If my wife is talking more comfortably with people around, I am envious. ‘She is not that comfortable with me, she is so comfortable with others!’ is my mental thought. Small little things can upset your ego and you feel hurt. She takes me for granted but she is so comfortable with other male members in the group. These are subtle problems. Inferiority complex, jealousy, poignant forces squeeze you to desperation. You lose sleep for several days. Such forces can be melted away in one suggestion built on vedāntic truths that there is an inherent freedom inside you and that <strong>freedom stuff is called ātmā.</strong></p>
<p>Now I will take up questions from you.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Although I agree that we have control, there are certain times when we have to lose control?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> When I say I have control I am just referring to that normal freedom. If there is tooth ache, I have no control over the pain. Freedom that I am referring to is at the psychological level. If you insult me, if you hurt me, I can refuse to react.</p>
<p>Don’t apply this law for the body problems like stomach ache, head ache, pain due to an injection etc. Most of our sufferings are psychological. The freedom that is referred is at the citta level, not at the body level. One should not make a mistake here. I agree with you that, the first stroke of anger cannot be controlled. But, with gradual and repeated application of this knowledge, one gets desired results. It may take months, years, and for some people never in this life. It all depends on one&rsquo;s state of mind and stock of Vāsanā-s.</p>
<p>What I want to impress here is that, one should use this method to soften one’s stand on various problems. Please understand that there is this freedom in you. Using it or not using is up to you. Most of the time we calm down by auto suggestion. That is the freedom I am referring to. Now I am applying this freedom at all levels. <strong>This is all my sādhana.</strong></p>
<p>Thirty years ago, I was always concentrating. I was always researching. I defeated my horrible concentrating tendency by this argument. It is not your nityadharma as the śāstra puts it. It is an āropita dharma. It can come and go. Whatever is the āropita dharma, by the very definition, you can drop it. Your objection that it cannot be dropped overnight stands well. But the whole sādhana is excellently described by Kṛṣṇa in Bhagavad-Ġīta as:</p>
<p><strong>यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम् ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>ततस्ततो नियम्यैतादात्मन्येव वशं नयेत् ॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yatō yatō niścarati manaḥ-cañcalam asthiram,</strong></p>
<p>**tataḥ-tatō niyamya-ētāt-ātmani -eva vaśaṁ nayēt.**Bhagavad-Ġīta, 6-260</p>
<p>From whatever cause the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, let him refrain from that. Let him bring it under the control of self alone.</p>
<p>When mind goes vary, keep telling your mind that you will be steady; you will contain the forces. In course of time you will be able to attain manonigraha</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> But we all live together in a family or society or workplace and encounter problems- when something goes wrong, particularly when it is not your fault, the annoyance is there. Even if you suppress it at that point, sometime later it throws up at some other point. What of that?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Not necessary- This again is the result of our conditioning. Therefore it shows up. Now you are not suppressing it, you have proved to yourself that, even when the other person is at fault, you don’t have to work up yourself. So this quietness is based on the knowledge of your independence, your freedom, your autonomy. In the earlier method, it was suppression for decorum sake- that means you have every reason to get disturbed but you are not doing that at that moment. You were holding the very act of response, whereas here you have no cause to get disturbed. This is the realisation that you got from the study. Other fellow is at fault and you get disturbed. Given that other fellow is at fault, why you should get upset is a thing not known to man. Ātma is swatantra_, _alipta, untouched by anything good or bad. This new knowledge makes it clear that <strong>it is not suppression but it is sublimation</strong>. Let there be hundred errors in the world around -that need not touch me-**asaṅgo ayaṁ puruśaḥ- असङ्गो अयं पुरुषः -**a big vedantic saying. I remain untouched- this is what you have realised.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What about the instance when your children put you in that irritable mood. Then I have to react, in order to change him.</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> If the child keeps on doing mistakes, there you do the necessary correction.The whole śāstra is referring to the mental level. At the vyavahāra level you do any amount of correction without getting upset. Otherwise we make a mess of things. If a child is not corrected then the child is not rightly educated. We must tell that in many different ways like sāma, dāna, bheda, danḍa, and make the child understand. But, getting mentally worked up is not necessary</p>
<p>**Q.**More often we do the same mistake again and again although we know that it could have been the other way. Then the guilt feeling starts and this disturbs the whole pattern. What do you say for that?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> It is for this main purpose of getting rid of the guilt feeling one resorts to sādhana. After all what is sādhana? One has to let go the feeling that one is insulted or talked lightly about. **One should not chew the cud.**One should develop a state of indifference to such acts which give rise to anger, hatred, etc. One should set the clock in the reverse direction and take things in such a way that it does not create imbalance in the system. We should not develop the guilt feeling at all. A bit of repentance is fine, but balance of mind should come immediately.</p>
<p>This should happen in the case of desires also. Slowly but steadily one should get that understanding. A mere knowledge that it can be washed out is not sufficient. That is why vāsanākṣaya takes place slowly. One has to wash this down slowly and steadily, like the damped oscillations of a pendulum. It does not come down suddenly, but slowly. We should not try to justify our anger but must take a different attitude of letting go the things.For a few days it works slowly and thereafter it simply jumps to a higher level. The best way of negating an incompatible situation is by putting a question to you as —SO WHAT? This line of approach automatically brings down the impact of unruly forces.</p>
<p>By auto suggestions, self counselling, gentle counselling, a time comes when the forces are all reduced-this is the manana portion. Repeatedly recalling what we have listened in śravaṇa is manana.</p>
<p>Whenever you trip, whenever you falter, whenever you lose your poise, apply this method and a stage comes when the vāsanākşaya happens so much that even the suggestion is not necessary. This is nididhyāsa - śravaṇa improves into manana and manana improves into nididhyāsa. Nididhyāsa is a gentle sitting wherein the forces are so low that you can just diffuse them.</p>
<p><strong>Ātmaparicaya - आत्मपरिचय</strong>, **ātmābhyāsa - अत्माभ्यास and ātmaniṣṭha - आत्मनिष्ट -**are the three methods of identification for the progress.</p>
<p>**śravaṇa is_ _ātmāparichaya -**that is, identification of the true nature.</p>
<p>Then**manana is ātmābhyāsa -**repeatedly reminding the same.</p>
<p>And the steady state established through this process is<strong>nididhyāsa</strong>or<strong>ātmāniṣṭha_._</strong></p>
<p>Sukhaparīkṣa showed you another big truth. While our notion was, sukha is in the objects of enjoyment, Śāstra asked us to examine the nature of that sukha as to what happened to the mind at that point of your enjoyment. It was very clear to all of us that the mind refuses to think at that point, mind does not want to think, mind is incapacitated to think. In the grandeur of the ānanda the mind rests. The mind becomes decomposed, thought free. Technically speaking, mind has reached nearer to the causal state; mind has reached its pūrvasvarūpa- ātmasvarūpa or the brahmasvarūpa.</p>
<p>But, bhogasukha gives momentary joy preceded by restlessness and succeeded by restlessness. It is fractionated, segmental, incomplete and admixed joy. <strong>But we get a glimpse of that śāśvatasukha in this bhogasukha.</strong> Therefore one has to see this welcome element and stay firm in it and then <strong>drop the agency.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> If I go to a person and tell him to try coffee as a tool for sukha he is not satisfied, as he basically does not like coffee. How to convince him?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> That is easily answered. Coffee cannot give joy to everybody. One’s taste is what is important. To some, sweet is repulsion. You cannot take the example then. I have tried many different types of things to show that expenditure of energy takes place as per the model suggested by me when certain centres are activated. I would have a music put on. Of course, music of my choice, otherwise, resonance vibration would not happen. Just before listening to the music, I would watch myself how much restless I was. While listening to the music the restlessness goes. Why? The explanation is that the centre of hearing is expending the excess energy thereby giving relaxation at the mental level. If the music is stopped, then again pressure builds up soon. This is a proof that music pushed you to a no mind state resulting in joy.</p>
<p>Most of you know the wire and the tuning fork experiment. There is a distance between the vibrating body (the tuning fork) and the wire. If you take the tuning fork near the wire, then the wire vibrates in resonance. When the right matching frequency is there, a very large slice of the energy is shifted to the wire and it starts vibrating. If we place a small piece of paper on the wire, the paper flies off to show that the wire is vibrating.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: What about Boredom?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> As we saw earlier, when the music is applied comfort sets in because boredom force is burnt away by the principle of resonance vibration as demonstrated in the above experiment. A very large slice of the energy can be drawn away. Śṛuti and the Vedānta have explored this very well.</p>
<p>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad makes a beautiful comment. Why don’t you watch the happiness of sex, which is the highest happiness in the esteem of man? The Upaniṣad makes a point.</p>
<p><strong>तद्यथा प्रियया स्त्रिया सम्परिष्वक्तो ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>न बाह्यं किञ्चन वेद नान्तरम् ॥</strong>(Bṛh. Upa, 4-3-21)</p>
<p><strong>Tadyathā priyayā striyā sampariṣvaktō,</strong></p>
<p><strong>na bāhyaṁ kiñcana vēda nāntaram.</strong></p>
<p>The best of sukha is the laingikasukha. But why don’t you see the mechanism involved? What courage on the part of vedantic scientist? How did the woman give you joy? Or, what did the woman give you in the name of joy? She put you into the no-thinking state.</p>
<p>**Na bāhyaṁ kiñcana vēda -**You know nothing of the outside. Hundreds of problems bothering you do not touch you at that moment.</p>
<p>**Na antaraṁ kiñcana vēda -**You know nothing of the inside. I mean, you don’t even study the mechanism because that will take away the joy.</p>
<p><strong>एषोऽस्य परम आनन्दः, एषास्य परमा गतिः।</strong></p>
<p><strong>ēṣaḥ-asya parama ānandaḥ, ēṣāsya paramā gatiḥ.</strong> (Bṛh. Upa, 4-3-21)</p>
<p>This is your exalted state. This is your richest state -world doesn’t exist for you. You are a zero inside. There is a vacuum. The knower, the known, and the knowing process are all dissolved. <strong>Tripuṭināśa-त्रिपुटिनाश</strong>has happened. It is a sheer emptiness. In ever so many ways it is showing you what is that <strong>ānandasthiti</strong> which is nothing but an expansion inside.</p>
<p>**Q.**Why one cannot have śāśvatasukha by involving more and more of bhoga?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> If taking coffee leads you to brahmasukha, then why don’t you have more and more of coffee? Why don’t you have more sweets in order to get that brahmasukha continuously? The answer lies here. <strong>Although bhogasukha works by this mechanism, it has a defect. It is short lived.</strong> This shifting of the energy is only temporary. Every indriya has a limit point to draw or shift the energy to its respective centre. The first sweet is remarkable, the second sweet is acceptable, and the third sweet is repulsive. Even at the cost of annoying the host you say, ‘sorry I cannot take it’, why? The system cannot manage. The tongue fails to draw that energy. At that point, the energy goes back into its original place, the ajnācakra and again you become restless. That is the reason why bhogasukha is short lived. During bhogasukha, preceded by a disturbed state and succeeded by a disturbed state, for a small interval of time in between, the mind quietens.</p>
<p>If you can reduce the creation and the release of energy itself, the permanent effect remains. Without this ineffective method of shifting the energy to another indriya centre, if you can naturally reduce the release of energy itself by slowing down (adopting naidhānya way), then you can naturally expand your shell which is vistārata</p>
<p>In a small sphere, the amount of thrust or the hit on the unit area is more. That&rsquo;s simple physics. Suppose the sphere is very big, the same thrust or hit on a much bigger sphere is much smaller. Distributed over a larger area, you don’t feel the burden at all.</p>
<p>So, apply the rule of <strong>naidhānya - नैधान्य</strong>, apply the principle of <strong>vistāratā</strong>- <strong>विस्तारता_ or _vaishālyatā</strong>- <strong>वैशाल्यता</strong>. Then the boredom forces are automatically absorbed or swallowed away and you don’t complain at all. This is a permanent method to be always happy.</p>
<p><strong>So, a vedāntin is not running away from bhoga for ascetic reasons. He, as a happy person, can be in vistārata with or without bhoga.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. What happens if we reject objects of bhoga?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. We shouldn’t do that. We would injure the system. We need not stop taking sweets, etc. All this is necessary. Abruptly we cannot stop bhoga. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa gives us a very good wisdom. In the first phase of sādhana one should do 25% of this vicāra 75% of bhoga and at the second phase 50% of this vicāra and 50% of bhoga and at the third phase 25% of bhoga 75% of vicāra is to be practised. At the final stage one can always keep quiet depending upon his level of cittaśuddhi.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Does viśayasukha or bhogasukha alone is the contributing aspect of gaining peace of mind?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> This is another good objection on sukha. But it is the peace of mind that is referred to as sukha in the tradition. Actually in our viśayasukha moment, although the penultimate position is in excitement, the real point is in peace. We are tempted to say that this excitement is a sukha element. The penultimate centres are in excited state and therefore one is tempted to conclude that sukha carries the element of excitement. But the real thing is that the penultimate position, that is the taditarasthāna as we put it in Sanskrit, is in excitement whereas the samīpasthāna_ _or the ultimate position has an expansion which constitutes peace.</p>
<p>Our difficulty really is, when we are talking about happiness, we are just using words, but we do not know what happiness is in rich measure. That is why recapitulation of content of sukha is not possible, as we deal only in words saying that ānanda is bliss. The best of ānanda we know is the nidrā phase. So, if you can get a feel of that ānanda, in wakeful hours, then you come into real touch of that state.</p>
<p>Some time it happens. Profit by that, says the śāstra. Irrespective of the moments when you have a high measure of peace and satisfaction, you are becoming familiar with that quality of mind which is close to brahmasukha_._ Why not continue to stay like that. Gauḍapāda puts it beautifully in Kārika, 44, Chapter 3 of Māṇ. Up:</p>
<p><strong>लये सम्बोधयेत् चित्तं विक्षिप्तम् शमयेत्पुनः।</strong></p>
<p><strong>सकषायं विजानीयात् समप्राप्तं न चालयेत् ॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layē sambōdhayēt cittaṁ vikṣiptam śamayēt punaḥ,</strong></p>
<p><strong>sakaṣāyaṁ vijānīyāt samaprāptaṁ na cālayēt.</strong></p>
<p>(If the mind becomes inactive, arouse it from laya; if distracted, make it tranquil. Understand the nature of the mind when it contains the seed of attachment. When the mind has attained equanimity, do not disturb it again.)</p>
<p>When you get that tranquillity, hold on, do not disturb that. Then it is a mahāsādhana. There are hundreds of occasions like going to pilgrimage, going to a forest side, going to a river bed, going to temples etc where you put yourself into that calm state. So, any occasion which gives peace in the heightened measure makes recollection of that state easy.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. While one is practicing this method and attain a reasonable amount of purity of mind devoid of anger and jealousy, external forces like selfishness of people around you, dishonesty, unfaithfulness, etc may disturb you from time to time. How to come out of this?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. The answer to this is given in Chāndogya Upaniṣad:</p>
<p><strong>सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानीति शान्त उपासीत ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sarvaṁ khalu-idaṁ brahma tajjalānīti śānta upāsīta.</strong> (Chāndogya Upa 3-14-11)</p>
<p>Everything is verily Brahman. Contemplate, with devotion, on its creation, sustenance and dissolution.</p>
<p>There is nothing like wrong, filth or foul, everything is brahma. Pettiness is an activity version of Brahma. Dishonesty is an activity version of Brahma. Unfaithfulness is an activity version of Brahma&ndash;the same pure Brahman is manifested in those phases there. Everything is the functioning version of Brahma. Therefore it is respectable, worthy of salutation. When one takes this stand then complaining goes. Unless complaining goes, you cannot be comforted.</p>
<p>You are fine with yourself. But, when you see all these around, within the family and outside, do not get disturbed by it. If you ask me how performance can go on in such a state, you do the necessary interference and corrections but keep in mind that the same pure Brahma has become all this. In Rudra mantra and Devi- stuti, you will find that salutation to all types of people. The hint from the śāstra is that you cannot accuse any one- you cannot find fault with others- then the satisfaction comes automatically. Śankara’ puts it as:</p>
<p><strong>कामक्रोधरहित आसन् उपासीत ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kāma-krōdha-rahita āsan upāsīta.</strong></p>
<p>Worship the world and the various forces therein without any attachment or dejection.</p>
<p>So, this additional information should be remembered by the students who take to Jñānamārga. It goes by the method of suggestion. You begin to operate gently at every situation in life.</p>
<p>**Q.**What is your opinion about meditation in order to attain the state of happiness?</p>
<p>**A.**Meditation, according to Vedānta, is comfortable sitting or relaxed sitting. One could always be happy as in nidrā where one spends six or seven hours without any worry or burden. Vedāntic meditation is non-focusing. You need not have even the support of omkāra or candle light gazing or things like that. Instead, sit and enjoy—</p>
<p><strong>एकान्ते सुखमास्यतां ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>परतरे चेतस्समाधीयताम् ॥</strong>(Sādhanapañcaka, 5)</p>
<p><strong>Ēkāntē sukham-āsyatāṁ,</strong></p>
<p><strong>paratarē cētaḥ-samādhīyatām.</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy the blissful solitude, through equanimity of mind.</p>
<p>How easy! What a recommendation! You are asked to be comfortable- that’s all. If you are convinced of the vedantic truths, just relax so that every joint gets loosened, even at the muscular level, let alone at the mental level**. It looks funny but true.**That is meditation.</p>
<p>And if focusing comes, a small attention comes. Just advise yourself that it is not necessary and you begin to diffuse. You begin to get back your quality of expansiveness. Layers and layers of diffusion can happen with this way of relaxed sitting culminating in expansiveness.</p>
<p><strong>That is why, when people say that realisation is instantaneous and total, I have reservations about it and I feel that the expansion is a gradual process.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>. Are there different levels of expansion?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. When you say, you are comfortable you have expanded from the focusing stage to a leisurely state. Even in nidrā or sleep, total expansion has not occurred. But, prāṇa spandana is there. Otherwise, why would the forces come back once you are awake? Relatively we are more expansive and the expansion can go on until cessation of prāṇa happens.</p>
<p><strong>अप्राणो ह्यमानाः शुभ्रो ह्यक्षरात् परतः परः।</strong></p>
<p><strong>A-prāṇō hi-amānāḥ śubhrō hi-akṣarāt parataḥ paraḥ.</strong> (Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad, 2-1-2)</p>
<p>The glorious state of tuirīya is beyond the mind, prāṇa and the unmanifeseted.</p>
<p>What are you?&ndash;no prānic vyāpti at all, no cittavyāpāra, no prāṇavyāpāra. That is the tuirīya state.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Can you elaborate the difference between nidrā and turīya?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Śankara goes in detail as to why Nidrā is not the ultimate. Most people stop at Nidrā in the avsthātrayaparīkṣa. How does turīya differ from nidrā? For both the states, there is no cognition – there is no dwaithavyāpāra. There is absence of perceiving jagat and perceived jagat. Then why don’t you call nidrā itself as the ultimate? Gouḍapāda, in the Mānḍuklya Kārika beautifully answers this state-</p>
<p><strong>बीजनिद्रायुतः प्राज्ञः सा च तुर्ये न विद्यते ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bījanidrāyutaḥ prājñaḥ sā ca turyē na vidyatē.</strong></p>
<p>(Māṇ. Up 1, Kā. 13)</p>
<p>The seed of ignorance which is prevalent in sleep, is absent in tuirīya.</p>
<p>In nidrā, although a no mind state is reached, vyāpāra has not ceased. Triputi has gone- manovyāpāra has gone- but nonetheless you are in vyāpāra. Prāṇaspandana is there.Relative centres were perhaps blocked. Once these centres resume work again, you are very much in vyāpāra. You immediately ask for your bed coffee or rush for your news paper as soon as you get up&mdash; all the forces are back in action. <strong>You thought you were very quiet but the forces were all in the bīja or seed form, that is, in the form of small spandana or vibration</strong>. You just slipped into sleep but, somehow and somewhere the forces were not tamed by a process. So you come back. Citta-laya had happened in nidrā_, _citta-nāśa had not happened.</p>
<p>How does the sādhaka then tackle this?&ndash;He begins to tame the forces and kills them. The forces are vanquished in the sādhana phase. Therefore there is no residue. There is nothing like coming back to any worldly desires. A man going to samādhi this way, when he comes back he is equally soft- that is all. This is called Jāgrannidrā. That’s the difference between nidrā and turīya. Śankara clearly explains the difference between nidrā and turīya thus in Śankarabhāṣya 22 on Kārika, 2 of  Māṇ. Up. 1</p>
<p><strong>दर्शनस्मरण एव हि मनः स्पन्दते। तदभावे हृद्येव अविशेषेण प्राणात्मना अवस्थानम् ।</strong></p>
<p><strong>Darśana-smaraṇa ēva hi manaḥ spandatē, tadabhāvē hr̥di-ēva aviśēṣēṇa prāṇa-ātmanā avasthānam.</strong></p>
<p>When the dream phase is not there, when the jāgrat phase is also not there, how do you exist? You are merely in the pulsating phase in nidrā. Chāndogya Upaniṣad (4-3-3) declares-</p>
<p><strong>स यदा स्वपिति प्राणमेव वागप्येति, चक्षुःप्राणं, श्रोत्रं प्राणं मनः प्राणं, प्राणोह्येवैतान् सर्वान् संवृङ्क्त इति ॥</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sa yadā svapiti prāṇaṁ-ēva vāk apyeti, cakṣuḥ prāṇaṁ, śrotraṁ prāṇaṁ, manaḥ prāṇaṁ iti- Prāṇo-hi-ēva-ētān sarvān samvṛṁkta iti.</strong></p>
<p>In nidrā, every activity has gone in to that general activity. Each specialized activity has taken a general version but has not been eliminated. Prāṇa has absorbed in its womb all the specialized activities like seeing, listening, talking, and thinking. But activity has not gone in nidrā. Therefore it comes back in the jāgṛt phase. By consciously taming the forces in jāgṛt never to re-appear again, you slip into turīya state.  Therefore a jñāni cannot become angry again, since anger has been conquered consciously-boredom has been conquered consciously-focusing has become diffused, over a phase of sādhana.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Are we afraid of the state of Turīya?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes&hellip; Man is afraid of that utter non doing state. That is why one has to take things in a gentle way. My own definition of turīya is—it is a state where Jāgṛt is not amplified, nidrā is not amplified. But, that is the source from which general activity and specialized activities have sprouted. In the wakeful hours you sit and say to yourself not to worry, not to excite yourself and by such auto suggestions you reach turīya. That will be conscious undoing of forces which you have not done when you go to sleep.</p>
<p>Over a period of sādhana, even the verbal version, I am fine, I am not doing anything must also stop. In Nidrā we don’t have the feeling that we are happy. Obviously both the verbal version and the pictorial version stop thereby a process of slowing and softening occurs. That is why we should not be bothered about the ultimate position. That is only for academic reference.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What do you mean by existence of thoughts in verbal or pictorial way?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Thought can exist in only two forms- pictorial version or the audio version, i.e., the verbal version. For example, when I say that I am going to Bangalore-it could be my Bangalore house. Bangalore is reduced to śabdarūpa or the citrarūpa. If you analyse still further- you may not have these two details in the mind. But you may be in the process of forming a thought which is called**Cetyonmukhata -**in a mood to know, in the process of crystallizing into a thought which can be called in my words as ‘CONING’. One can be in coning state without getting a picture or a sound for a thought to shape itself. Even that is a duḥkha sthāna. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha explains the cit_ and _cētya aspects very well:</p>
<p><strong>चेतश्चेत्योन्मुखत्वेन दुःखायायमहं स्थितः</strong>।</p>
<p><strong>cētaḥ-cētyōnmukhatvēna duḥkhāyāyamahaṁ sthitaḥ</strong>.   (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha. 6-9-382)</p>
<p><strong>Cit</strong>is svarūpa** -**a diffused version of you.</p>
<p><strong>Cetya</strong>is the one which has shaped itself in to objects**- Nāma, rūpa, karma-**picture or sound or a movement.</p>
<p>In between these two there is a process called **Cetyonmukhata-**in the process of shaping itself in to a thought. If Cētya has not set in, then whatever you are I (ego) - the creating phase, the attentive I&ndash;the suffering I, taxing I, tiring I. It is the jnātṛ. In nidrā this I is dropped. <u>But it is not the ultimate <strong>‘I’</strong> </u></p>
<p>What a penetration as a scientist -Coning takes shape while formation of each thought. When the coning effect is not there, that is to say, when thoughts are not coming at all, that is the state of comfort. <u>We should sit for meditation in such a way that concentration/attention should be absent.</u> <u>Then only meditation becomes comfortable.</u></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why is coning not comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Because you are in the knowing phase, you should drop that knowing phase also. If you ask any person who sits for meditation, he is bound to say that he gets disturbed after ten minutes, because this knowing phase itself is burdensome. That should go in order to get ānanda or bliss in any meditation.</p>
<p>A child doesn’t stare. A child is not educated into staring at you- that’s the beautiful thing. If you look through an Ophthalmoscope into such eyes it shows a diffused look. We actually train the child to stare and spoil the diffusion of the child. Instead of diffusion the child develops the habit of looking into details only to observe things.</p>
<p><strong>नाल्पेसुखमस्ति भूमैव सुखं । –</strong>(Chāndogya Upa 7-23)</p>
<p><strong>Na-alpē-sukham-asti bhūmaiva sukhaṁ.</strong></p>
<p>Bhūma is stretched state. Ānanda is not in looking at small things. But science says that you should look into small details. But Vedānta says otherwise. If you want ānanda, drop this habit of looking at small things. The indriyā-s are used to focussing. Attention is the pre state of every thought. Even in meditation, if you sit in a concerned way as to know who you are, then it is burdensome. IF you GIVE UP THAT concern, then, that is ānanda. One has to let things go or let thoughts go, and then only one can progress further. This is the truth, but it is anti performance as per science. It is a hard fact.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Is there any upāsana mentioned in the Upaniṣads for the practice of meditation?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> A very interesting incident is narrated in Chāndogya Upaniṣad wherein methods of sādhana or UPĀSANA are mentioned. It is, as it were, that the entire gamut of sādhana methods is put, in just five words.</p>
<p>A teacher is taking leave of his students after they have completed their course. One student however is left out and he is asked to wait. The student is very much pained and starts wondering if he had not satisfied the master.</p>
<p>The teacher goes out of the Āśrama for a few days and the student refuses to take food, as he is very much disturbed. He goes to the special room where agni upāsana takes place and sits quietly. Two or three days elapse and Agni which is burning in that room has a sense of guilt and offers a boon to alleviate the sin he has acquired by letting the student in Agnigṛha without food.</p>
<p>Agni announces- well, I give you a special wisdom as a compensation for the tapas you did so that you can liberate yourself.</p>
<p><strong>प्राणो ब्रह्म कं ब्रह्म खं ब्रह्म । -</strong>(Chāndogya Upa. 4-10-4)</p>
<p><strong>Prāṇō brahma kaṁ brahma khaṁ brahma.</strong></p>
<p>Prāṇa is the general activity- you can go to the origin by using the śabda version of the jagat and go on softening till a threshold point comes where you are omkāra-mātrā. That also silences itself into svarūpa. You can also have prāṇa as the activity of the jagat-like emotions and feelings which are not coming in the śabda format or the dṛṣya format. To soften these, you have to do <strong>prāṇopāsana-</strong> by softening the prāṇavyāpara to such a level as to reach the no mind state. This is <strong>Prāṇo hi Brahma</strong>. Drop all complexities of the verbal version or the word version and try to stay in omkāra and you will soon be in svarūpa. Prāṇopāsana is to quench the śabda version of the jagat.</p>
<p>The next is** Khaṁ brahma.** Khaṁ means ākāśa. Do the <strong>ākāśa Upāsana</strong>- that is handling the rūpa position. Details and multiplicities are to be reduced into a mere focusing state and then expansion has to be tried. Go by the picture way- and come to a point where you are just cognizing and then smash that cognition by letting go the point formation.</p>
<p>The next one is**kaṁ Brahma.**Ka is ānanda. What is svarūpa? ānanda mātrā&mdash; effortlessness. Do the anusandhāna of ānanda. <strong>Ānanda upāsana</strong> is to remain happy and contented at all times, relax and be at ease, even when unpleasant things are there.</p>
<p>That is the real prescription to a sādhaka. These are inner sādhana methods one has to take up relentlessly.</p>
