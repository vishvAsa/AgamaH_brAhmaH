We will now discuss the details of practice to be undertaken at each functional centre. Let us first take up the **CITTA**or the mind centre.

If you sit and start contemplating on Brahma (Nirguṇabrahma), you will only waste your time ending up in developing headache. Instead, have a picture of God of your choice and engage your mind on that. It is a wonderful tool in your hands. Now you relate yourself with your Iṣṭadevata. If you are a Hindu you have many gods to choose. If you are Christian, then keep a picture of Jesus or Mother Mary. A certain amount of sanctity is also established by that process which will be helpful. You can even think of your Guru. If both god and guru are not acceptable to you, then have a candle light to gaze. You are connected with a person or thing which <u>does not excite the mind</u>.

How can likes and dislikes play when you have connected yourself with a deity? Selfishness, hurry or dislike does not come to the mind. So, the citta gets purified and at the same time energy is spent away and emptiness sets in. The required gain is there because boredom forces are spent away in this way. That means, the levels of speed and focusing come down and you have an exponential expansion. Your expansive state of mind is automatically got.

Śubhakarma is the method we should adopt since we are not fully prepared for pursuing Jñānamārga or the Yogamārga. We are not fully prepared for the first two. If your system is prepared for yoga or prāṇāyāma then it is fine. In addition, spend some hours in sākāradhyāna to establish yourself firmly on the path. There is no Hindu family that doesn’t do these things. How can it be a ridiculous point about a culture, when examinedin this light, as it takes you to near brāhmic state? If one understands this concept clearly, the shame associated with multi god concept vanishes.
