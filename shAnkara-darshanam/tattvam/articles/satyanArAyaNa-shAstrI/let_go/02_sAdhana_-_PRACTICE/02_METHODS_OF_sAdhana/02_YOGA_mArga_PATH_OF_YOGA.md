**Yogaḥ citta vṛtti nirodhaḥ**as per Patanjali. **yogo cittarodhohi-**as per Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha.  In the later, through suggestions you are softening the mind and purifying it, whereas in the former, you are actually controlling the forces. I hope you see the slight difference there. Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha further declares that:

**मनः प्रशमनोपायो योग इत्यभिधीयते ।**

**Manaḥ praśamanōpāyō yōga iti-abhidhīyatē.**

(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha 3-9-132)

Mellowing the mind is termed as yoga. It is tuning the mind from the harsh state to gentle state. So, sit and quieten the mind. You decide an interval of time where your duty calls would not come and disturb you. That is the skill with which you have to work. You have to be in a relaxed state for attaining peace.

One could ask this question as to whether it is possible to soften the mind by suggestion.

Yes, it is possible. For example, when you are walking, you are fast and ahead of your wife and your wife asks you to walk slowly and you immediately start walking slowly. How did you change from walking fast to walking slow? Yoga method is naturally available in the system. This system is capable of yoga method as it is capable of adopting Jñānamārga. Both methods are compatible with human system. Manipulations are possible. You can vary the rate of the forces inside. A doctor comes to you- wants to examine the chest for inflammation and he puts the stethoscope and asks you to take deep breath. How did you vary your breathing? You did that under the instruction from a doctor. This is a facility available at all functional centers of the human system.

**Let us study the vāksthāna-**that is the place from where sounds emanate. It is possible to stretch (elongate) the śabda or sound and go to the moola or its root until a sentence decomposes into words, words decompose into letters, letters decompose into OM, and then OM decomposes into silence.. Through śabda, as a vehicle, you can apply the slowing process, until you touch the origin. Remember the famous sentence of Shri Rāmakṛṣḥṇa Paramahamsa. Sandhyā merges into gāyathri, gāyathri merges into OM and OM merges into silence.

This is beautifully shown in Mānḍūkya Upaniṣad while dealing with parts of OMKĀRA- **Akāra** as crude,**Ukāra** as sutler, **Makāra** still sutler. Then the Upaniṣad says- **amātraḥ charthopādaḥ-**there is the unuttered sound. That means, it goes to the pre state, a very sūkṣma phase, then it becomes silence- just the idea of touching the origin or swarūpa.

The next centre is the**respiration centre-**śvāsa-sthāna. Wonderful tool because it is coarse and is workable. Respiration for most of us is random, irregular and if one starts regulating the same- through the famous Nāḍiśuddhi Prāṇāyāma you get your stillness. Even hidden cellular disturbances vanish with the practice of simple nāḍiŚuddhi prāṇāyāma. The process of nāḍiśuddhi pranāyāma has to be acquired from a person who has a good knowledge about it. One should not try without guidance, otherwise one may harm oneself.

These are more external, grosser, and easier for the average man. Each one is excellent in its application, in its benefits. Much of your physiological problems are solved. In addition to giving you the peace required, the grandeur of the practice is, that all other centres get purified if one centre is taken care of. The inner vega is changed into naidhānya. Spiritual growth happens in you.

**Q.** Can we work on the breathing coupled with expansion techniques?

**A.** When the system is conducive, you can work. It cannot be a single tool. It can be all combinations. The whole point is that mind should become zero. It is not that some tools are superior and some tools are inferior. Anything is useful.

**Q.** Naidhānya as you say is to reduce the release of energy. Can we not do that at the breathing level?

**A.** Generally respiration is irregular. How to cultivate the slowness at the crude centre, the nostrils? Take the breath slowly, hold it and then release it slowly. After a few months of practice, you start breathing slow automatically. But the śāstra says that all this is not necessary. One has to mentally slow down. Then everything falls in place. One can recite Gayatri Mantra very fast or... could be recited leisurely. One can incorporate slowness at the talk centre or at the respiration centre.

**Q.** No doubt fastness of mind is troubling us. Fear of slowing down the mind is actually causing the mind to be fast. Is it so?

**A.** This is the problem with people who complain when they_ don’t get sleep_. If it was one day of not getting sleep, then there is no problem. The next day he starts worrying about not getting sleep. When the worry or the fear about not getting sleep aggravates or exaggerates then, he should realize that, fear must go. That fear so created, develops a bigger fastness than the existing fastness. After two days of no sleep, he tends to conclude that his system may be damaged or he may be unfit to operate. And then, fear takes away the sleep all the more. First of all he must remove this fear. Not much happens if one loses sleep for many days. System can manage it. It has a cushion. A medical friend of mine told me that two hours of sleep per day is enough for any healthy person. Some people’s system learns to relax even in the wakeful hours and hence less sleep is sufficient.

Taking every vyāpāra as a holy one is a brahma sādhana. Every indriya vyāpāra is a mechanism by which the boredom forces get diffused resulting in a relaxed state. The sunken state turns into expansive state.

**सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानीति शान्त उपासीत ।**

**Sarvaṁ khalu-idaṁ brahma tajjalānīti śānta upāsīta.** (Chāndogya Upa 3-14-11)

**तज्जं तल्लं तदिति  - Tajjaṁ tallaṁ taditi.**

It is born out of silence. It ends in the silence and is sustained by the silence. Upāsīta-we must take the jagat very reverentially. We are always selecting, denouncing, criticising which we should put an end to.

**कालातिवाहनायैव विनोदाय क्रियोदिता ।**

**Kālātivāhanāya-ēva vinōdāya kriyā-uditā.**

(Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha. 6-9-244)

All these kṛyās are just there to pass time! One need not run away from life and vyāpāra. Every karmakāṇḍa prescription is to quench this vega. This would be the interpretation to the benefit of the karmakāṇḍin, who did not know this benefit. He thought that God is there and that He would give him some favour. But the other part of the story here is that chittaśuddhi is happening. Karmakāṇḍin is reaping the benefits of Vedānta automatically.
