We have understood the main difference between Jñānamārga and Yogamārga and have studied the various methods that can be adopted to mellow the mind. The question arises now as to why we should look for other methods of sādhana when these two methods are more than sufficient to put us in the desired path.

If one carefully examines, these two paths are very difficult to adopt for common people like us who have great load of rajas and tamas compared to those who are advanced in their pursuit.

If one sits for meditation for long periods, pressure builds up at the ajnācakra and one feels like getting up. In fact if a fresher sits for meditation, in two minutes he wants to get up and be done with. That goes to prove that even two minutes of meditation is not possible. One may even end up getting headache.

If the mental composure is of that order for people like Vāmadeva or Śuka, the moment they listened to the truth they are in the state of samādhi. What about people like us then? Similarly applying yoga by slowing down the breath is also not easily possible.

That is why people like us should not try these methods unless we are under the guidance of a teacher. For most of us these methods work only in a limited way. Then how can we proceed? Is there no method for us?

When we come to sādhana, unless vāsanākşaya starts taking place in us, progress cannot be achieved. Every one of us including a sanyāsi who has given up worldly activities has to undertake continuous process of vāsanākşaya. For different people, stationed at various levels of progress, the teacher can only give the message. The student has to take up his own assessment as to where he stands in the path through extrapolation.

We all have a large stock of load or burden of vāsana that has accumulated over a long period and it is not easy for us to get a relaxed state unless we dissolve all forces like greed, anger, attachment, miserliness, jealousy and self pride. Since one overrides the other it is almost impossible for us to get away from them. Every time we make some progress, we seem to get back to the starting point. Unless serious efforts are put to contain these forces, it is not possible to get a relaxed state of mind.

Do not bother about how long it should be done. You should reach a stage where, even the questioning attitude should collapse. Udāsīnabhāva has to set in. Questioning is a severe state of mind. Searching is an energized state. By solving the question, the energy does not vanish. Only by dropping the question itself, the energy tones down. Both vāsanākṣaya and manonāśa are interdependent. We have to develop an attitude of let go of things to start from scratch.

Our ancient Rishis thought about all these and devised many simple methods to be adopted during our own life cycle to weed out the habits which are deep rooted in us. They made it mandatory for everyone to take up these programmes as a matter of discipline. They went to the extent of saying that these are ordained and not questionable. Hence they incorporated daily rituals like worship and meditation. The methods like performing rituals and offerings to God, creating many gods to suit every type of person and giving one the freedom to choose, were all meant for mellowing  the mind

All our activities are driven by rāga, dveṣa, bhaya, krodha, kāma etc. We are moulded into involving with wrong values due to loads of vāsanā-s or wrong conditioning. In view of this, we end up in generating more and more unruly forces getting very badly caught in the whirlpool of life. Karmakāṇḍapractices are devised in such a manner as not to be performed in a hurry. The objective is togain slowness. The whole intention of karmakāṇḍais to attain cittaśudhi. Knowing the implications of karmakāṇḍa and practicing the same or simply practicing without knowing the implication makes a mountain of difference.

All our ancestors, my father, my uncle, my grandfather, everybody was a karmaniṣṭha of a very high order. But, they were peaceful at the time of worship only. They would fret and fume the next moment after they are done with the rituals. That was because, they did not understand that the benefits gained from karmakāṇḍa had to be prolonged for a longer span. The peace they got from this was not continued by them, for lack of understanding of why and how of karmakāṇḍa methods.

The peace got during the karmakāṇḍa hours should percolate to the other hours also. Otherwise it has no meaning.Śankara’s position is very clear that all karmakāṇḍa methods are meant for purifying one’s own mind and nothing else**- Citta-śuddhyarthaṁ- चित्तशुद्ध्यर्थं.** So, karmakāṇḍa has to be practicedonly for that gain and nothing more.

So, when you are unable to sit peacefully, get into an activity <u>like religious activity, pious activity, neutral activity, mechanical activity, any passive activity. </u>The Hindu mind showed its genius this way. Do not try to sit quiet, since sādhana will not happen forcibly. Engage yourself in activities which fulfil the condition suggested here. Whole of Hindu methodology and Hindu’s everyday life is built on doing sacred pūja, engaging in religious chanting, doing japa which are all **non- exciting**.

Everyone is spending his or her energy in eating, talking chatting, and so on—All these activities can be brought under the gamut of sādhana provided, you expend the energy in such activities <u>where the mind is not disturbed in the process</u>. All such activities can be called as NEUTRAL ACTIVITIES. That is all the prescription.

This is the most important portion of sādhana wherein karmakāṇḍa practices are to be re accepted. I have coined the word for this as **ŚUBHAKARMA.**

We are going to prove here that for vedāntic gains, karmakāṇḍa is the only way though it looks incompatible. When the stock of vāsana is more the only way to reduce the same is through karmakāṇḍa practices. You go back to japa, you go back to sahasranāma paṭhaṇa, and you go back to formal pūja. Once again, this primitive, trivial, seemingly absurd lookingprogramme is what we have to go back to.

Jñānamārga would be inapplicable with students havingbig stock of rajas and tamas--even yogamārga cannot be applied. Then what is the solution for them? Do we not have a way out? And that is exactly where Indian genius has worked out wonderfully. The best of Indian research to me is thedevelopment of karmakāṇḍa details. The westerners mock at the way we have number of Gods, instead of one God. They even laugh at the idea of Gods having many wives and their children whom to be worshipped!

One can choose a god of one’s taste and preference. It is a plus point to Hinduism, not a minus point. I worship Lakshmi if I want wealth, I worship Sarasvati if I want scholarship. If I want a peaceful contemplating God, I choose Īśvara. I can design my god to suit my taste, and relate myself with the deity. This is the defence of karmakāṇḍa. The karmakāṇḍa, which is seemingly rejected, now comes as our saviour! Karmakāṇḍa caters to any human being, depending on his/her mental status. These are derived to reach the required goal. When a learned man is chanting the mantra-s with accurate intonation and one hears them, the result is a peaceful state. The peace that we have to acquire in the name of Brahmasādhana is achieved.
