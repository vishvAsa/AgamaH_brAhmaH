title = "+02 METHODS OF SĀDHANA"

+++

Now, we will look into details about the different methods of sādhana. We will elaborate four principle methods which lead us to the state of happiness. They are Yogamārga, Jñanamārga, Śubhakarmamārga and Prema and Bhaktimārga. An important point to be noted here is that all these mārgā-s have no distinct demarcations. They overlap and sometimes merge into the other. The purpose of elaborating them under different titles is to give you an idea of their distinct features.

**YOGAMĀRGA AND JÑĀNAMĀRGA**

The Yogamārga is a path of action. Jñanamārga is the path of right understanding. Patanjali, in his yoga sutra says:

**योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः**। - **yōgaḥ-citta-vr̥tti-nirōdhaḥ**

This is the first sutra. Yoga is to quieten the mind, to soften the mind or to mellow the mind. How do you achieve this?

**अभ्यासवैराग्याभ्याम् तन्निरोधः।**

**Abhyāsa-vairāgyābhyām-tannirōdhaḥ**.

This second sutra is an answer to the first one. He lays down the premises. Two techniques are suggested- abhyāsa_ and _vairāgya_._

The same point as it were, is bodily passed on in Bhagavad-Ġīta. Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna to practice **manonigraha—**to tame the mind. But Arjuna is confused—

**चञ्चलं हि मनः कृष्ण प्रमाथि बलवद्धृढम्।**

**तस्याहम् निग्रहं मन्ये वायोरिव सुदुष्करम्॥**

**Cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kr̥ṣṇa pramāthi balavat-dhr̥ḍham,**

**Tasya-aham nigrahaṁ manyē vāyōriva suduṣkaram.**(Bhagavad-Ġīta, 6-34)

Arjuna says it is very difficult to do that- he would rather be able to tame the wind rather than the mind. Kṛṣṇa agrees with him and says-

**असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम्।**

**अभ्यासेन तु कौंतेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते॥**

**Asaṁśayaṁ mahābāhō manō durnigrahaṁ calam,**

**abhyāsēna tu kauṁtēya vairāgyēṇa ca gr̥hyatē.**

(Bhagavad-Ġīta, 6-35) 

There is no doubt that mind is very unsteady, very fickle and it is very difficult to subdue it. Mind can be subdued by abhyāsa_ and _vairāgya. Whatever Pathanjali said, the very thought is here -- to show the consistency in tradition is maintained-

What is abhyāsa and what is vairāgya? Abhyāsa is actually taming the forces. Vairāgya is vedāntavicāra- or renunciation born out of vicāra.

This thought is made even clearer in Yoga-Vāsiṣṭa. Rāma asked the question as to how to tame the mind? Vāsiṣṭa says-

**द्वौ क्रमौ चित्तनाशाय योगो ज्ञानं च राघव ।**

**योगस्तद्वृत्तिरोधो हि ज्ञानं सम्यगवेक्षणम् ॥**

**Dvau kramau citta-nāśāya yōgō jñānaṁ ca rāghava,**

**yōgaḥ tat-vr̥tti-rōdhō hi jñānaṁ samyak avēkṣaṇam.** (Yoga-Vāsiṣṭha, 5-9-72)

My dear Rāma, there are two methods for quietening the mind, for purifying the mind. What are they? They are Yoga and Jñāna. Suppose there is speed and disturbance of mind. In Yogamārga you slow it down by riding on it. Whereas in Jñnānamārga you slow down with right understanding. This definition is more comfortable and convenient. So, Jñāna is right understanding of things, thereby replacing wrong notions by correct notions. That is the jñānamārga which results in renunciation of wrong values which is VAIRĀGYA in the real sense.
