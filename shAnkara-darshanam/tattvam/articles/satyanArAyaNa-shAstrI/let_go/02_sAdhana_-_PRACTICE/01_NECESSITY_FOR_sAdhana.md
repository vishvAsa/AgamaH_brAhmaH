title = "01 NECESSITY FOR SĀDHANA"

+++

In these five lectures we have done a study on the theoretical part of vedānta**- वेदान्त**. This can be called śāstrabhāga -**शास्त्रभाग** or siddhānta -**सिद्धान्त -** portion. We can say we have covered the siddhānta portion, the logical aspect or the theoretical aspect so far. Let us deliberate on the practical aspect or the sādhana -**साधन**– portion of vedānta.

In the examination of self or ātmaparīkșā-**आत्मपरीक्षा**, two references were given, namely the Pañcakośaviveka **- पञ्चकोशविवेक**and the Avasthātrayaparīkșā **- अवस्थात्रयपरीक्षा**. They are two samples of prakriyā **- प्रक्रिया** - two methods of investigation.

Every Upanișad has one or two prakriyā-s. Irrespective of the methodology tried in the Upanișad, you could design your own prakriyā - one can design his own prakriyā to get convinced of the vedāntic truths. A modern mind has an advantage in designing a prakriyā because science has given it those advantages. Sureśvarācārya **- सुरेश्वराचार्य -  **a big thinker and a direct disciple of Śankara, makes this point that one should not be sticky about the prakriyā. It is not that pancakośaviveka_ _or the avasthātrayaparīkșā are the only two tools available.

**यया यया भवेत् पुंसां व्युत्पत्तिः प्रत्यगात्मनि।**

**सा सैव प्रक्रियेह स्यात् साध्वी सा चानवस्थिता॥**

**Yayā yayā bhavēt puṁsāṁ vyutpattiḥ pratyagātmani,**

**sā sā-ēva prakriyēha syāt sādhvī sā-ca- anavasthitā.**

Whatever methodology that can take you to the source or to your true nature, is accepted as a prakriyā. What a liberal thinking on his part! Do not say it is ancient or modern-sā sā eva prakriyā sādhvī-that itself is an honourable prakriyā. All that prakriyā has to do, is to take you to your true nature. If it serves the purpose then it is a prakriyā. There is no sanctity about it as it were.

In fact I myself proceeded on the following lines of investigation - What am I? I am a thinker. Am I always thinking? Obviously the answer is no. I have a thinking phase. But, I am not always thinking- all the 365 days, all the 24 hours. Therefore thinking is not my nature because I have a nature otherwise of it. Similarly, I am talking. Am I always talking? No. So what am I then? I am not talking is equally correct as I am talking. I am not thinking is equally correct as I am thinking. Every bit of my activity has a complimentary phase.

One more example- I am angry. Am I always angry? No. That means I have a no-angry phase.  I have a no activity phase also. I thought that I am always active, I am always a doer. But here is a ready proof that I am **equally a non-doer**. See the force of this argument. If you can understand this much, the Vedānta is understood and appreciated. Our first impression is that I am a doer because I am doing this or doing that at ever so many function centres. But equally so, I do not have that quality of doing always. I am listening but not always. So, my phases of existence wherein I am not listening, not eating, not sleeping, mean I that I am not doing these act always. **I am also a non-doer as much as I am a doer too**. Our weightage is on our doer’s role which we always thought is our nature. This notion of doer ship is weakened by the above logic. So, this is also a prakriyā, a simplified prakriyā. This not only re-sets values but also takes you to your svarūpa **- स्वरूप**. Why do you say this is your svarūpa? The study suggested in vedāntic tradition puts us into the new truth that I am as much a non doer as I am a doer.

Then the question would be why does one extol this non doing role? What is so extraordinary about that? This question also must be answered to one's satisfaction. The answer is, that this non doing is a comforting phase, as we discussed the other day. Vijñānakośa **- विज्ञानकोश**- is a toiling phase and ānandakośa is a comforting phase. You cannot belittle your non doing role. It is more precious than the āyāsasthāna **- आयासस्थान**. One can easily understand the difference between two convictions. I have this non doing phase which is viśrāntisthāna - **विश्रान्तिस्थान**- whereas the doing phase of mine is āyāsasthāna. While the former is a healing phase the later is a fatigue phase.

Putting this in another way- all that is necessary is to prove it to oneself the unimportance of thinking and uselessness of thinking. Our present notion is that thinking is a must, is useful and hence it is our real nature. You have to break these two positions by vichāra. That is all what Vedānta wants us to know. We have to show the hollowness of this equation by showing that happiness that one gets out of objects of enjoyment, content wise, is a state of quietness wherein mind becomes empty.

When you enjoy the ice-cream, ice-cream did not carry the element of joy. By a strange mechanism, it pushed the mind into the non- doing state for a short period. That is all the role of any bhogavastu. This parīkșa is necessary to get a conviction. We have over simplified the study by saying that ice cream gave us joy. It is a very superficial study.

<u>Ice cream gave you joy by shifting the energy from boredom centre which is our thinking centre or Ajnacakra, down to the tongue centre, thereby creating an emptiness at the thinking centre resulting in joy.</u> See the freshness of this study! **It was nothing but an agent to divert the bothering energy from ajñacakra-sthāna down to the concerned centre or the involved centre.**

If it is music, then the energy is drawn into the ear centre. Bulk of the energy is drawn away by the principle of resonance leaving a very small residue at the thinking or the mind centre. Therefore you are almost in a non thinking phase, non-doing phase. You are touching your emptiness and emptiness is sukha. This is to prove the unimportance of thinking. We went on glorifying the thinking phase (in performance) as very valuable tool and that is gone now. In fact, once you are convinced you begin to laugh at your earlier life style and conclude how foolish you were, how absurd you were, with all your brilliance and performance!We do not have to drop karma or activities, but, our inner values should change and that is the big difference. The gusto or the false importance goes and you become a new person. By some style of argument, you have to prove to yourself the limitation of necessity and usefulness of thinking**. **But the Vedānta shows that you have an option to this. It is not your nityadharma or your natural disposition.

At this point, it is appropriate to remember Śankara who has such a sharpness of thinking which no scientist would have had. He suggests a simple study in Śankarabhāșya, Bŗhadāraṇyaka Upanișad (4-3-20)

**तस्या अविद्यायाः किं स्वाभाविकत्वं आहोस्वित् काम कर्मादिवत् आगन्तुकत्वम्?**

**Tasyā avidyāyāḥ kiṁ svābhāvikatvaṁ āhōsvit kāma karmādivat āgantukatvam?**

Is, this thinking your natural dharma or superimposed dharma? This is all the study to be made. Avidyā is cognising, emotionally involving and doing. Avidyā, kāma, karma is the triple point. Is this your svabhāva-dharma or āgantuka-dharma? Svabhāva-dharma is the natural quality, āgantuka-dharma is something borrowed or superimposed. This line of thinking will solve the question. Hence:

**यदि च आगन्तुकत्वम् ततो विमोक्षः उपपद्यते।**

**Yadi ca āgantukatvam tatō vimōkṣaḥ upapadyatē.**

If it is borrowed from outside or if it comes and goes it can be dropped by the very definition. Otherwise:

**यदि स्वाभाविकत्वं मोक्षप्रसङ्गोपि नास्ति ।**

**Yadi svābhāvikatvaṁ mōkṣa-prasaṅgaḥ-api**

**na-asti.**

If anger, jealousy, disturbance, thinking were to be your natural quality nobody can take it away. No Śāstra can take it away because it is your natural quality. Whiteness is the natural quality of milk. You cannot think of milk without the whiteness. Similarly, thermal quality is the nityadharma of fire. You cannot think of the fire without the heat quality, without the heat component. Heat is the nityadharma of agni. If the qualities like anger etc are your nityadharma-s, it must conform to this definition. Anger is not nityadharma because it comes and goes. Thinking is not your nityadharma because it comes and goes. None of these attributes come under the category of nityadharma. So, you can drop it by the very definition. Yadi_ _āgantukatvam_ _vimokșaḥ_ _upapadyate_-_ thinking is droppable, and worrying is droppable.

All that one has to examine is just two minutes of study to check <u>whether it comes under the list of nityadharma or that of āropitadharma</u>. All our attributes are coming under the second category. Show me an attribute which is nityadharma of a human being. How sharp is this argument? I was sold over to the great thinker Śankara. That’s all Vedānta! One can forget ten Upanișad-s and  Śankarabhāșya. Deliverance**can come by this simple argument.**

Number of models could be arranged by a clever mind to show that one has a non-doing phase, and that is precious. Doing is not a must and doing is not absolutely valuable. Until this conviction comes, you cannot come out of suffering because the urge to do goes on and that is the load that we always carry. One cannot sit comfortably because, one keeps on thinking about doing. One has to break this burden, by the argument that non doing gave sukha and that is the one which will give ultimate happiness. This is the conviction that one gets by sādhana.

Does this mean that one should stop one's profession or earnings? We are not yet prepared for such an extreme step and till then one should slowly progress in the path of renunciation.

Since we have understood so much, our irritability must stop, jealousy must stop, our worries must stop. But this does not happen. With this mere understanding the mind or citta does not become quiet. This can be illustrated by the experiment we did in our college days-- the gathered momentum of the fly wheel. Fly wheel is a big mass and is on its ball bearings so that there is least friction. You turn the flywheel a few times and release it. It moves on for another ten minutes or so, long after the force is withdrawn

The same example is taken in Vedānta- **kulāla cakravat - कुलाल चक्रवत् -** the wheel of the potter which keeps moving even after he removes the driving stick. Similarly, the forces that have gathered in us have become so strongly conditioned, almost to a point of rigidity, that it cannot be erased by simply acquiring the knowledge about de-conditioning. Conditioning is what is called as VĀSANĀ. It is a very satisfactory explanation. Since man has been always thinking for many lives, thinking has become his nature. Habit has crystallised into a status of law. So this wisdom cannot cancel these forces. So, śāstra paricaya_ _alone is not sufficient. A phase of de-conditioning is very much needed. This is termed as VĀSANĀKșAYA. Forces are annihilated only if there is a very high degree of citta_ _śuddhi.

Only two examples of great men are quoted in parampara. They just listened from the teacher and they were in svarūpa. Garbhasthaḥ_ _Vāmadevavat - There was a R̥ṣi named Vāmadeva. While he was in his mother’s womb, he heard the Vedānta being talked outside from his father and when he was born, he was declared a Brahmajñāni. It was said similarly with Vyāsā’s son Śuka. He was by birth relaxed. Śankara gives a ruling in all such cases.  Śankarabhāșya (200) on GauḍapādaKārika, 3-40  states that:

**नोपचारः कथञ्चन इति अवोचाम ।**

**Nōpacāraḥ kathañcana iti avōcāma.**

In such cases no prescription or methodology is necessary. Sādhana is not necessary---**teșām śravaṇam - eva alam- तॆषं श्रवणमॆव अलं** - for them one listening will do and they are set in Svarūpa **–**

**अतः अन्ये योगिनः मार्गगाः हीनमध्यमदृष्टयः . . . मनसः निग्रहायत्तम् अभयं सर्वेषां योगिनाम् ॥**

**Ataḥ anyē yōginaḥ mārgagāḥ hīna madhyama dr̥ṣṭayaḥ . . .  manasaḥ nigrahāyattam abhayaṁ sarvēṣāṁ yōginām.**

What about others who have big stock of rajas and tamas? For such people a long drawn a sādhana programme is necessary**. **Gauḍapāda also affirms this in his following Kārika on Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad (Man. Up. 3, Ka.40)

**मनसो निग्रहायत्तम् अभयं सर्वयोगिनाम्।**

**दुःखक्षयः प्रबोधश्चाप्यक्षया शान्तिरेव च॥**

**Manasō nigrahāyattam abhayaṁ sarva-yōginām,**

**duḥkhakṣayaḥ prabōdhaḥ-ca-api-akṣayā śāntiḥ-ēva ca.**

For all of us manonigraha is required. Taming of the mind is required because mind is very much strong and bulky filled with rajas and tamas. So a process of sādhana is required.

I will now take up questions from you.

**Q.** What are Vāsanā-s?

**A.** Vāsana has two lakșaṇā-s. The first aspect is speed, that is, you are in a hurry at different functional centres. Rājasic man is structurally very fast. The second aspect of vāsana is focusing or having serious concern about a problem. The two put together sums up vāsana. When these two are brought down, vāsanākșaya begins to happen.

Vāsana is also spandana. Boredom is also a mere movement which is called as moola-avidyā or anādyavidyā - unspecific or unlabeled activity. The best English word for the vāsana is boredom according to me or mere helplessness, something which makes you uncomfortable. Every activity of man is to burn this energy that is accumulated in the ājñācakra or the thinking centre to become comfortable.  More often one talks away his boredom forces. The child cries away its boredom forces. Yoga-Vāsișţha puts it thus-

**वासना तानवं राम मोक्ष इत्युच्यते बुधैः।**

**पदार्थवासनादार्ढ्यं बन्ध इत्यभिधीयते॥**

**Vāsanā tānavaṁ rāma mōkṣa iti-ucyatē budhaiḥ,**

**Padārtha-vāsanā-dārḍhyaṁ bandha iti- abhidhīyatē.**   Yoga-Vāsișţha 1-3-58)

Thinning of tendencies is liberation, where as intense attachment to objects is bondage.

What is mokșa? To get rid of the boredom forces by gradually thinning them through sādhana.

**Q**. Don’t you think vāsanā-s are habits!?

**A.**Habits are nothing but conditioning gathered over a period of time. In any emotional situation there is destruction of vaiśālyata or the ākāśadharma due to narrowing to a constricted state which are called habits. In classical terminology, they are desire, rāga dveșa, krodha etc. Destruction of your vaiśālyata or the ākāśadharma is nothing but creation or point formation. Even Lord Brahma has to do tapas or fixing. The famous stanza from Taittirīya Upanișad (2-6-4) is as follows-

**सोऽकामयत बहु स्याम् प्रजायेयेति। स तपोऽतप्यत**।

**Saḥ-kāmayata bahu syām prajāyēyēti, sa tapō tapyata.**

Brahman thought that he had to focus to generate multitudes. So he started preparations.

**Q**. What does conditioning give rise to?

**A.** In the subtlest way it is boredom forces.

**Q.** Why we cannot sit for long hours without complaining?

**A.** We get tired even when we sit for half an hour. We say we are pressured. The sādhana is to soften this pressure because the conditioning has been so strong over the years. If you believe in rebirth, for hundreds of years you are conditioned to probe, focus, etc. The pressure of boredom forces has been amplified. Even though one has the knowledge about the fact of internal happiness, he goes after the objects of enjoyment because enough tapasya has not been done by him. That’s why siddhānta (theoritical knowledge) is not sufficient. Śāstra- paricaya is not sufficient. Sādhana phase is required. All traditions refer to a long drawn sādhana.

**Q.** How does jñāna help in vāsanākșaya?

**A.**Śāstra says or sampradāya says that the clarity or the conviction, about one’s own nature will start defeating the vāsanā-s. Śankara’s position is-- knowledge or conviction about sukha and duḥkha, will start defeating the whole range of Vāsanā-s. <u>The knowledge is imprinted on the memory centres at the sub conscious level and they go on operating even without one knowing it. </u>

**Q.** How the build-up of forces takes place?

**A.** We are all conditioned to involve ourselves in one or the other activity day in and day out. We cannot think of a person without any activity. Majority of us feel that it is a crime not to do any work. Although we have seen in detail that non doing is our svarūpa and that is the sukha sthāna, no person can be happy without doing. Even I cannot do that. Why? Due to the pressure of boredom forces, one is driven to activity. Everybody who says that he is doing work for so many good reasons is due to the fact that he cannot keep quiet. The proof for this is very simple. If I challenge you to sit quiet for ten minutes without doing anything, you may say that it is very easy. But if I ask you to remain quiet for half an hour, then you fail the test. Why? Yogaśāstra gives an answer to that point.

There is what is called a life force, a vital force or kundaliniśakti in us. It originates at the mulādhāra cakra and is continuously releasing the vital force or prāṇaśakti into the system, to every part of the body. It flows up into the higher centres or the urdhvasthāna, and comes to Ājñācakra (the thinking centre or the seat of the intellect) and develops a pressure. If the rates at which the energy produced and expended are not equal, one develops pressure which can be termed as the boredom force. And the pressure so developed drives you into activity. This is the most reasonable explanation. 

**Q.** What is the difference between Vāsanākșaya, Manonāśa and ātmābodha?

**A.** There is an interesting stanza from Yoga-Vāsișţa. He uses three terms - vāsanākșaya-manonāśa - ātmabodha. We can understandVāsanākșaya as vēga (speed) coming down. Manonāśa is the elimination of involuntary formation of pictures and sound. This is possible by defocusing. What is ātmabodha beyond these two? Ātmabodha is the vistārata or un-broken oneness property of self.

**समकालं समभ्यस्ता भवन्ति फलदा मुनेः।**

**एकैकशो निषेव्यन्ते यद्येते चिरमप्यलम्॥**

**Samakālaṁ samabhyastā bhavanti phaladā munēḥ,**

**ēkaikaśō niṣēvyantē yadyētē ciram-apyalam.**

(Yoga-Vāsișţa 5-10-116, 117)

<u>One has to practice all the three simultaneously</u>.

I can merely keep focusing without any creation (that is, without picture and sound). Here vāsanākșaya has not happened but manonāśa has happened.

I could be slow and still keep focusing in the background of vistārata. Then both manonāśa and vāsanākșayahave happened.

Forthe karmakāndin who is busy doing Yajña, japa and other religious activities,vāsanākșaya is happeningconsiderably this way without even his knowledge. He is slow in arranging the things required for the Yajña. Although he has slowed down, he is capturing details. He has not removed the focusing. Manonāśa has not happened.

Let us repeat this again: <u>When there is no picture formation manonāśa has happened. Suppose you do the focusing slowly, vāsanākșaya also happens. Still it is not the ultimate.</u>

Ātma is omnipresent - has the property of everywhereness. Localisation is the opposite of everywhereness. Although there is sam<u>ā</u>dh<u>ā</u>na for a Karmakāṇḍin, non-localisation has not happened.

As long as you do not overcome the defect of localization you cannot attain brahma although you may be happy and peaceful. In meditationwe may have reduced speedbut we are still in the attention mood (focussing mood). That is why most of the meditators will be watching time waiting to get up. For years people meditate but are unable to get the bliss that has to be got.The missing element - **let go**- should happen. When that starts, tons of comfort is possible. The missing state is the expansiveness-which in other terms called as ātmabodha.

Once this is recognized, the faculty opens and **let go** happens.That is the most difficult thing to do.For this, we have to practice vairāgya and udāsīnabhāva together. It is a matter of time and experience.

So, to put things in a nutshell, accept whatever method suits you, pursue that method which puts your mind in a peaceful state.
