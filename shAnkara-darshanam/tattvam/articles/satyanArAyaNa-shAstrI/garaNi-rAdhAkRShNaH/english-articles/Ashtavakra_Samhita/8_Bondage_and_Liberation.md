title = "8: Bondage and Liberation"

+++

**Ashtavakra said:**

** 8.1 When the mind desires or  grieves  things, accepts  or  rejects  things, is pleased or displeased by  things-- this is bondage. **

IGNORANCE AND KNOWLEDGE.

Bondage: Bound by ideas.

[B] Desire, sorrow, renunciation, acceptance, joy, anger.

**8.2 When the mind does not desire or grieve, accept or reject, become pleased or displeased, liberation is at hand.**

All ideas reduced to cognition only.  No attachment to any idea.  Let ideas come and go. My ashrama, my [unreadable] no such thing there. “My” is the test of the Jnani.

** 8.3 If the mind is attached to any experience, this is bondage. When the mind is detached from all experience, this is liberation**

You can see things, but if the “I” is not there, no harm..

Attachment involves “I”.  The first idea to come and the last idea to go is this “I”.

**8.4 When there is no “I” there is only liberation. When “I” appears bondage appears with it. Knowing  this, it is effortless to refrain from accepting and rejecting.**

The argument of the yogi, the religious, the practical man - Why should I worry myself with [S] jnanam or [S] danam (wealth), if there will be no “I”?

Rejection: Even rejection involves the expression of the ego.
