** Janaka said: **

**6.1 I am infinite space; the universe is a jar. This I know. No need to renounce, accept or destroy.**

WHAT IS REAL KNOWLEDGE

Boundless: Don’t think that you are limited in your body. Nothing is to go.  To know the world, its real value – this is [S] jnanam and not shutting one’s eyes.

A jar:  Space inside and outside. No Nirvikalpa samadhi.  All that is rubbish.

** 6.2 I am a shoreless ocean; the universe makes waves. This I know. No need to renounce, accept or destroy.**

Like the wave:  In me. Nor accepted:   i.e. accepted as it is. But it must be accepted as my own Self. You cannot give up this world and run away.  Wherever you go there is the Atman. There is nothing else than me.  So what is to be accepted?  I cannot destroy myself also.

** 6.3 I am mother-of–pearl; the universe is the illusion of silver. This I know. No need to renounce, accept or destroy.**

** 6.4 I am in all beings; all beings are in me. This I know. No need to renounce, accept or destroy.**

All beings: How to understand this?

Go to dream or Modern Science. Brahman means knowledge of the whole universe.   If anything is left out, it is not jnanam.   If you say what is the use of Science, what is the use of this or that.  I shall see truth inside – you are talking nonsense.  You must inquire into all that is possible to inquire into.
