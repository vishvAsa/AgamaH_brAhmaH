title = "9: Detachment"

+++

** Ashtavakra said: **

**9.1 Opposing forces, duties done and left undone— when does it end and for whom? Considering this,  be ever desireless, let go of all things, and to the world  turn  an indifferent eye. **

SEEKER AND WORLD

Chapter on discipline. Renunciation: From the standpoint of the [S] sadhaka (seeker). Indifference: Who is the person who will be benefited?

Ask all these questions. Then you will find that these things do not touch you.

**9.2 Rare and blessed is one whose desire to live, to enjoy and to know, has been extinguished by observing the ways of men. **

By observing:  Look at the world and examine this world.  These do not lead to ultimate satisfaction.  What did Napoleon achieve?  What did Alexander do? Even Sri Krishna died…and so on.  Beginning of [S] vichara (analysis).

**9.3 Seeing  all things as  threefold suffering, the sage becomes still. Insubstantial, transient,  contemptible-- the world  is fit only for rejection.  **

All this:  Everything you see in the ways of men.  Worthy to be rejected:

Contradiction to the position of Sloka VIII. 2.

Because this is the stage of discipline.

** 9.4 Was there an age or time men existed without opposites? Leave the opposites behind. Be content with what comes. Perfection**

This is the next stage (second stage).

**9.5 The greatest seers, saints and yogis agree on very little. Seeing this, who could not be indifferent to knowledge   and  become still?**

The whole philosophy of Vedanta. Saints and  (your friends the)  yogis  [the swami’s insert in the text]. Our idea of truth, not contradiction.

The question of questions is, “How do I know that what I know is truth?”  That is the problem of problems.

**9.6 One  who through worldly indifference, through serenity and reason, sees his true nature and escapes illusion— is he not a true  teacher?**

By means  : It is a step.

Reasoning: It won’t do by [just] sitting in Ramana ashrama or Aurobindo Ashrama.

** 9.7 In the myriad forms of the universe see the primal element alone. You will be instantly free, and abide  in Self. **

First of all, this analysis will show that your body also is made up of five elements.  Then you will see that the elements also are ideas.

**9.8 Desire creates  the world--renounce  it. Renounce desires and you renounce the world. Now you may live as you are.**

In this disciplinary step, when you reach the top there is no question of renunciation.
