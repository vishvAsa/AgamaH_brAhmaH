** Janaka  said**

**4.1 Surely one who knows Self, though he  plays the  game of life, differs greatly from the world’s bewildered burdened beasts. **

SEEKER’S EXPERIENCE 1.He may be enjoying, but his mind will always be in Brahman alone. The deluded beasts of the world  [text changed to]: these fools who are deluded by the world.

Game of enjoyment: [S] lila – not taking [it] seriously.

**4.2 Truly the  yogi feels no elation, though he abides in the  exalted  state yearned for by Indra and all  the discontented  gods. **

You have to pass through the yogi stage. You must train your mind [in] equanimity.

Yogic discipline [training of the mind] is meant as a preparation to [S] _jnanam_.

Cf.  _Vairagya Shatakam_,  Verse 40: [There is one Enjoyment (the supreme goal) and one alone, lasting, immutable, and supreme, of which the taste renders tasteless the greatest possession, such as the sovereignty of the three worlds, and established in which a Brahma, Indra, or the gods (i.e. their positions) appear like particles of grass.  Do not, oh Sadhu, set your heart on any ephemeral enjoyment other than that. –   The  Hundred Verses on Renunciation, translated by Swami Madhavananda, published by Advaita Ashrama].

**4.3 Surely one who knows  That is not touched by virtue or vice, just as space is not touched by smoke, though it  seems  to be.**

Both are the same.

** 4.4 Who can prevent the great soul, who knows the universe as Self, from living life as it comes? **

Universe to be the Self:  Not that the universe will not be seen. Cf.  Vairagya Shatakam.  [No specific verse mentioned.]

**4.5 Of the four kinds of beings, from Brahma to a blade of grass, only  the sage can renounce aversion and desire.**

**4.6 Rare is he who knows  himself as One with no other— the Lord of the Universe. He acts as he knows and is never afraid.**

He does:  He does not sit idle like an owl.
