title = "7: Nature of Self-Realization"

** Janaka said:**

** 7.1 In me,  the shoreless ocean, the ark of universe drifts here and there in the winds of  its  nature. I am not impatient.**

PRACTICAL LIFE AND KNOWLEDGE

In me: Not the ego. The universe taken as a whole is constantly changing.

[B]  I am the ocean, the entire world.

** 7.2 In me, the shoreless ocean, let the waves of  the universe rise and fall as they will. I am neither enhanced nor diminished**

I neither increase nor decrease thereby:

Mind is mind always.  When you see the Himalayan mountains in a dream, your mind does not increase.  If you do not see, your mind does not diminish.  Mind is mind always.  This is the essence of Vedanta. When it appears it is in Brahman.  When it disappears still Brahman is.  A Jnani always feels Brahman.  He is the last person to keep quiet even when an ant suffers.

**7.3 In me, the shoreless ocean, the universe is imagined. I am still and formless. In this alone I abide. **

**7.4 The Self is not in objects, nor are objects  in the pure and infinite Self. The Self is tranquil, free of attachment and desire. In this alone I abide**

If you think of the forms different from Atman, they are not in Atman.  But if you think that forms also are the mind, then the forms also are in the Atman. The Self  (as different from objects)

[the swamiâ€™s parentheses in this verse]  is not in the objects nor  as  the object  (as different from Atman)  in That which is infinite and stainless.

**7.5 I  am Awareness alone. The world is passing show. How can thoughts arise of acceptance or rejection? And where?**
