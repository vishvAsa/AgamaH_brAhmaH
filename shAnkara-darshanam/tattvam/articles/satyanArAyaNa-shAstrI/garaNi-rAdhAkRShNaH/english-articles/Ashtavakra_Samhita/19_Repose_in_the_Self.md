SEEKING REST IN ATMAN

**Janaka said  ---   **

**1. I  have extracted from the inmost  recess  of my  heart  the thorn  of  different opinions, using the pincers of the knowledge of Truth. **

**2. Where  is  dharma, where is  kama, where  is  artha? Where,  too, is  discrimination, where is duality, and  where,  even,  is  non-duality  for  me  who  abide in  my  own glory?**

**3. Where is  past, where  is future,  where,  even, is  the  present? Where is space, and where even, is eternity for me who abide in my own glory? **

**4. Where  is the  Self  and where is  the  non-Self,  where, likewise, are good and evil, where is anxiety or non-anxiety  for  me  who abide  in my  own  glory?  **

**5. Where  is dreaming, where  is deep  sleep, where  is  wakefulness, and where is the  fourth state;  where,  even, is fear  for me who abide in my own glory?  **

**6. Where  is  distance or  proximity;  where is exterior, where  is interior; where is grossness,  and where is subtlety  for  me  who  abide  in my  own glory? **

**7. Where is life or death, where are  the worlds, and where are worldly relations; where is lapse,  and where is concentration  for me who  abide in my  own glory? **

**8. To  talk  about the three ends  of life is needless, to talk about  yoga  is purposeless, and even to  talk about wisdom  is  irrelevant for me  who  repose  in the Self**
