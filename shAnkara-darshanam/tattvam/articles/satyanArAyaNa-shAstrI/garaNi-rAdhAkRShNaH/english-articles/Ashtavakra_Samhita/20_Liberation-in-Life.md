REALIZATION AND LAST STAGE OF LIFE

** Janaka said  --- **

** 1.   Where  are  the  elements, where  is the  body,  where are the organs,  and where  is the mind;  where is the  void; where,  too,  is  despair for  me who  am  taintless  by nature? **

**2. Where  are the scriptures, where  is knowledge of the Self, where is  the mind not attached  to sense-objects, where is contentment, and where is  desirelessness for me who am  ever devoid of the sense of duality?  **

**3. Where is knowledge and where  is  ignorance;  where is  “I”,  where is “this”, and where  is “mine”; where is bondage  and where  is  liberation?  Where  is  an attribute to  the nature of my self?  **

**4. Where  are  prarabdha  karmas, where is liberation-in-life, and  where is even liberation-at-death for  me, the ever undifferentiated?   **

**5. Where is the doer  or  enjoyer,  where  is cessation  of  thought  or the rising  of thought,  where  is direct knowledge  or  reflected  knowledge,  for me who am ever Impersonal?  **

**6. Where  is the world  and  where  is the  aspirant for  liberation;  where is the contemplative  man  and  where  is  the  man  of  Knowledge,  where  is  the soul  in bondage  and where is  the liberated soul  for  me  who am  non-dual  by  nature?  **

**7. Where are creation  and destruction;  where is the end  and  where  the means; where are seeker and success for me  abiding in my non-dual  nature?   **

**8. Where  is  the knower,  the means  to knowledge, the  object  of knowledge or knowledge itself; where  is  anything, and where is  nothing for  me  who am  ever  pure?   **

**9. Where is distraction,  where is concentration;  where  is knowledge, where  is delusion;  where is joy  and where is sorrow  for me  who am ever actionless?  **

**10. Where is relativity,  where is transcendence;  where is happiness or  misery  for me who am  ever beyond  any discursive thought?  **

**11. Where  is illusion, where is the  world; where is  attachment or  detachment; where is  jiva  or Brahman for me,  who am ever pure?   **

**12. Where is  activity, where is  inactivity;  where is liberation  or bondage  for me who am ever immutable and indivisible, and established in the Self?   **

**13. Where are instruction  and scriptural  injunction, where  is  the disciple  and where  is the  preceptor;  where, indeed, is the  object of  life for me who am  absolute good  and  free from  limitation? **

**14. Where is  existence, where  is non-existence;  where is unity, where is duality?   What need  is there to say more?    Nothing emanates  from me.  **

Nothing emanates from me:  Because everything is Me (mind).   There is no causality.
