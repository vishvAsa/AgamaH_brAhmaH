title = "15: Knowledge of the Self"

+++

**Ashtavakra said:**

** 15.1 A man of open intuition may realize the Self upon hearing a casual instruction, while a man of cluttered intellect inquires  bewildered for a lifetime.**

SELF REALIZATIO Intellect: [text changed to] Determination [S] Buddhi.

** 15.2 Aversion to the world’s offerings  is liberation. Attraction to the world’s offerings is  the  suffering  of bondage. This is the  truth. Now do as you please.**

Distaste for sense-objects: This comes when they are known to be unreal.

B] Liberation says detachment…attachment, this is the essence of wisdom; now do as you please.

** 15.3 This knowledge of Truth turns an eloquent, wise and active man mute, empty  and  inert. Lovers of the world  therefore  shun it.**

[B] There is no use for the knower of truth to be eloquent. Who will understand?  You have to know that worldly enjoyments are lifeless.

** 15.4 You are not the body. You do not have a body. You neither do nor enjoy. You are Awareness only--the timeless Witness. You are free. Go in happiness**

4.You are not the body: This is known in the waking state from the fact that the body is continuously changing.  But you see the changes. Nor is the body yours:  You cannot claim this body to be yours.  The body of the years back is no more now.  It is continuously passing away.  The body sense prevents you [from seeing] the universal Self – the eternal witness. Witness: The witness in him, the witness in me, the witness in you – all are the same.

**15.5 Attachment and aversion are attributes of the mind. You are not the mind. You are Consciousness itself-- changeless, undivided, free. Go in happiness**

**15.6 Realize  Self in All and All in Self. Be  free of personal identity and the sense of “mine.” Be happy.**

Free from egoism:  First condition of Indian Philosophy.

**15.7 You are That  in which the universe appears like waves appearing in the ocean. You are  Consciousness itself. No need to worry. **

Indeed:  Undoubtedly.

**15.8 Have faith, my son, have faith. You are Awareness  alone, the Self, the One. You are the Lord of Nature.**

You: Whom you call “I” for I. Knowledge:  Not of the nature of “known”. Nature: To which you are attached.

**15.9 The body is made of worldly stuff. It  comes, it lingers, it goes. The Self neither comes nor goes, yet remains. Why mourn the body? **

The waves go back to the ocean, so the body goes back to yourself. Body may be changed, but the real “I” is never changed. Mountains may have appeared and disappeared in dream.  Where is the increase or decrease of the mind?

Destruction is an impossibility.  Nothing is ever lost – not even a pin’s point. When you understand that which is permanent, then you will see that even this body is never lost.

**15.10 If  the body lasts  until the end of time or  perishes  today— is there gain or loss for you? You who are  Awareness?**

You: Not the ego. The real I, that is found in him, in you, in A, B, C,-- all. How can this true “I” go?

Pure Intelligence: If you think that you are body, then your misery will not go.

** 15.11 Let the waves of the  universe rise and fall as they will. You have nothing to gain or lose. You are the ocean. **

In you:  Go to any part of the world – people will say “I”, “I”.  So no limit to this “I”.  It is infinite.

**15.12 You are the substance of Consciousness. The world is You. Who is it that thinks he can accept or  reject it? And where does he stand?**

This universe is nothing different from you: Sri Ramakrishna realized himself as being present everywhere.

**15.13 In you who are One— immaculate, still Awareness— from where can birth, action or a separate person arise? **

Birth: Who has seen the birth of the mind?

Egoism:  Where does this Subrahmanya Iyer go in sleep? “Know Thyself” as Socrates had said.

There is no harm in studying the external world, but go to the root of the thing.

**15.14 Whatever you perceive is  You and  You alone. How can bracelets, armlets and anklets be other than the gold they  are  made of? **

The preceding thought is further developed here. You need not be afraid of losing anything.  Everything will be your own Self. No reason for you to be miserable in this world.

(Cf. dream).  If you want satisfaction, this is the only way.  If you want truth, this is the only way.

**15.15 Leave behind  such distinctions as “I am He, the Self,” and “I am not this.” Consider everything Self. Be desireless. Be happy.**

Consider all as the Self: This person or that person.  The highest.  It is not mere religious faith.  It is a fact.

**15.16 Your ignorance alone creates the universe. In reality One alone exists. There is no person or god other than You. **

Exists: Has a reality independent of you.

Jiva: Individual soul.  No proof.  Can you measure your soul – how many miles it extends?  You can imagine as you like. Iswara: As you imagine.  I see only “many” bodies, but not many souls.

**15.17 One who knows for certain that  the universe is illusion, a no-thing, becomes desireless, pure Awareness, and finds peace in the existence of nothing.**

Nothing exists: Other than him.

**15.18 In the ocean of existence only One is, was, and ever will be. You are neither bound nor free. Live content and be happy.**

Live: Don’t run away from this world.  Live like all men. You are eternal.

Contented:  Discontent – when you have not attained this or that.  If you have become sannyasins, it is to render service to humanity, and not to get prostrations.

**15.19 Do not stir the mind with “yes” or “no.” You are pure Consciousness. Be still, and abide  in the bliss of Self. **

O Pure Intelligence: The thing we have to think twenty-four hours.  I am not the body, but the perceiver of the body. Right: The use of right thoughts are to get rid of the wrong thoughts.  Then the right thoughts [will] also have to go. Bliss:  If there is no sense of duality, there will be nothing to make you miserable.

**15.20 Give up completely all contemplation. Hold nothing in  the  mind  or heart. You are the Self, forever free. Of what use is thinking to you?**

Contemplating:  Thinking –  Duality –  Sorrow. Self: The only existing entity – the eternal –  the ever blissful.

Thinking: Thinking is necessary until you have reached Atman.  [See Part II. Verse 5]  We have to “duly consider” the universe and know it to be Atman.

Duality to the scientists is “mystery”, to the religious, “God’s Will”.  We don’t want either mystery or God’s will, we want Truth.
