title = "5: Four Ways to Dissolution"

+++

** Ashtavakra said: **

**5.1 You are immaculate, touched by nothing. What is there to renounce? The  mind is complex—let it go. Know the peace of dissolution.**

NATURE OF THE UNIVERSE 1.Before you say I renounce this, that will be gone.  Automatically it is being renounced. You are the [S] Drik.

[Section of unreadable Bengali]

As the Western Materialists, you see that the body and the world are constantly moving away – passing away.  So why should you be attached to these?

Dissolution – converting the universe into mind.

**5.2 The universe arises from you like foam  from  the sea. Know yourself as One. Enter the peace of dissolutio**The universe rises from you: You see this in dream.  In the waking itself ideas are going and coming.  If you have read enough science you will see that all this is an idea and it is constantly going and coming.  Depend only on religion [and] you will never get [S] jnanam – you can get peace, of course.

Existence is  a “constitution” of time - space.  Value is a constitution of “causality”.  World Existence  – Value.  World cause  – Time  - Space  Causality. –   Shyamlatal, August 3, 1941 [A quote from Swami Virajananda while in that Himalayan retreat].

**5.3 Like an imagined snake in a rope the universe  appears to exist in the immaculate Self but does not.   Seeing this you know: “There is nothing to dissolve.”  **

Even though it is present to the senses: The universe will be there always. Then alone you will be able to investigate and enquire about the nature of the universe.  You will know that this universe is Brahman.  Everything is in me, Atman. It is absurd to say that everything will disappear and then you will get [B] Brahman.

**5.4 You are perfect, changeless, through misery and happiness, hope and despair, life and death. This is the state of dissolution.**

When death comes, you will say that the body will go to myself.  Since it is an imagination
