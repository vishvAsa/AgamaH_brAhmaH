title = "13: Happiness"

+++

** Janaka said:**

** 13.1 The tranquil state of  knowing Self  alone  is rare— even among those  who own but a loincloth. I  therefore  neither renounce nor accept and am happy**

BLISS

Loin-cloth: If to you this is something other than yourself.  You must be able to see everything as Brahman.  Then, you will get perfect calmness of mind.

**13.2 The body  is strained  by  practices. The tongue  tires  of  scripture. The mind  numbs with  meditation. Detached from all this, I live as I am. **

Think of the body—there will always be some trouble.

Trouble of the mind:  These thoughts worry you – those thought trouble you.  I do not have this.  I have not that and so on.  So give them up as [S] Drishyam.           Don’t attach yourself to them.

**13.3 Realizing that nothing is done, I do what comes and am happy. **

There is nothing outside the Self.

**13.4 Yogis who preach either  effort or non-effort are still attached to the body. I neither dissociate  nor  associate with any of that and am happy. **

**13.5 I have nothing to gain or lose by standing, walking  or sitting down. So whether I stand, walk or sit I  am happy. **

**13.6 I do not lose by sleeping nor attain by effort. Not thinking in terms of  loss or  gain I am happy.**

**13.7 Pleasure and pain fluctuate and are inconsistent. Without good or bad I live happy **

When you are in the practicing stage, you have to renounce.
