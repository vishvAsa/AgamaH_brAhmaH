** Janaka said:**

** 12.1 Becoming first intolerant of action, then of excessive speech, then of thought itself, I come to be here. **

STEPS LEADING TO WISDOM

Janaka narrates the stages of discipline.   I want to know an idea of [S] Drik, the inmost thing.  So I have to detach myself from the [S] Drishyam.

Intolerant: I don’t allow them[objects] to interfere with my knowledge of [S] Drik.  Action, speech, thought, these are all [S] Drishyam.

**12.2 Neither sounds nor other  sense perceptions   attract my attention. Even the Self is unperceived. The mind is free, undistracted, one-pointed. And here I am.**

**12.3 Effort is required to concentrate a distracted mind superimposed with illusion. Knowing this, I remain here. **

**12.4 Nothing to reject, nothing to accept. No joy, no sorrow. Lord God  I am here. **

When the thought of Brahman comes to me. Rejection or acceptance [are] possible when you see difference.

**12.5 The four stages of life, life without stages, meditation, renunciation,  objects of mind— nothing but distractions. I  am forever here. **

**12.6 Doing and not-doing both arise from ignorance. I know this. And I am here.**

When there is a sense of duality, then alone one can “give up”. An ignorant man only will think of giving up and shutting himself up.

When you have attained [S] jnanam you have nothing to “give up”.  Everything is only Atman.

**12.7 Thinking of the unthinkable One unavoidably conjures thought. I choose no-thought and remain here. **

Exuberance of words and the man is only in the world of [S] Drishyam only.

**12.8 Blessed is he who attains this by effort. Blessed is he who is such by nature.**

By Nature: This [S] jnanam has been a part and parcel of his life.  It is always with him.
