  <p>** Ashtavakra said &mdash;  **</p>
<p>**1. Salutation  to  That which is bliss itself by  nature,  calmness, and effulgence, with the  dawning  of  the knowledge  of which all delusion  becomes  like  a dream.  **</p>
<p>KNOWER OF TRUTH</p>
<p>**2. One gets  plenty of  enjoyments  by  acquiring all  kinds of  worldly  objects.   Surely one cannot be happy without renouncing all. **</p>
<p>[B] Acquiring many things, we get lots of enjoyment; without renouncing gross and subtle pleasures, peace is far away.</p>
<p>**3. How can one  whose heart’s core  has  been  scorched by  the heat  of  the sun  of sorrow  arising  from  duty  enjoy  happiness  without the continuous shower of  the ambrosia of tranquillity? **</p>
<p>If your mind has been agitated with this and that woman or this desire, that desire, [there is]no objection if you go to Mount Kailasa [pilgrimage place in the Himalayan Mountains].</p>
<p><strong>4. This  universe is  but  a state of  consciousness.  In reality it is  nothing.   The existent  and non-existent do not lose  their inherent nature.</strong></p>
<p>Those self-existing beings: That which knows.</p>
<p>**5. The Self  which is absolute,  effortless,  immutable, and spotless, is  neither far away  nor  limited. It  is  verily  ever  attained.  **</p>
<p>**6. Those whose vision is unveiled as soon  as illusion  ceases and  the Self  is realized, live with their sorrows dispelled. **</p>
<p>**7. Knowing  all  as mere  imagination and  the  Self as  free and eternal, does the wise one act ignorantly  like  a child? **</p>
<p>If you cannot take the trouble to find out the nature of the world, you will say “it is all maya;” the grapes are sour!</p>
<p>Knowing all: You must “know” the world as imagination and not simply “say” that it is all idea; it is all idea.</p>
<p>Act like a child!:  The mind must be devoid of the sense of individuality.</p>
<p>**8. Knowing  for  certain that one’s self  is Brahman  and that existence  and  nonexistence  are figments, what does  one  who  is  free from desire, know, say  or do? **</p>
<p>Existence and nonexistence predicate [are attributes of] objects only. [B] Atman which is [S] Drik is beyond such predication. Figments: Ideas.</p>
<p>Know, say or do!: The whole of man’s life.</p>
<p>**9. Such thoughts as “this  indeed am  I”  and “this I  am not”  are annihilated for the  yogin  who has become  silent by  knowing  for certain all  as the  Self.  **</p>
<p>Just as religion is a necessary discipline, so yoga also is a necessary discipline. Faint: Gradually falls away. Yogi: This yogi has become a Jnani.</p>
<p>** 10. The  yogin  who has  attained  tranquillity  has  no distraction,  no  concentration, no increase in knowledge, no  ignorance, and neither pleasure nor pain. **</p>
<p>No concentration:  Brahman everywhere.  Nothing to be concentrated upon.</p>
<p>**11. In heaven  or  in beggary,  in  gain or  loss,  in society  or  solitude,  there is  no difference to  the unconditioned  yogin.  **</p>
<p>**12. Where  is  dharma  (performance  of ritualistic  or  meritorious works), where is artha  (worldly  prosperity), where is  kama  (sense-enjoyment), and where  is discrimination for  the  yogin  who  has  transcended such  dual notions as  “this  is  to  be done” and  “this is not  to be done”?    **</p>
<p>**13. The  yogin  who  is  liberated while living, has neither any duty  nor any attachment at heart.   His actions  pertain  to  the present  life  only,  being  merely  the effects of  his past  karma. **</p>
<p><strong>14. Where is  delusion,  where is  the universe, where is renunciation, moreover where is liberation for the great-souled one  who rests beyond the world of desires?</strong></p>
<p>[Corrected text]  Where is…where is  the state of …liberation  for the  greatsouled one who is resting beyond the  realm of all imaginations.</p>
<p>** 15. He who  sees the universe  may try  to  deny it.   What  has  the  desireless to do?   He sees not, even though he sees.  **</p>
<p>** 16. He who has  seen  the Supreme  Brahman  meditates,  “I  am  Brahman.” What does he who has transcended all  thought think, when he sees no second? **</p>
<p><strong>17. He, indeed, controls himself,  who  sees  distraction  in  himself.   But  the  great one is not distracted.   Having nothing to accomplish, what does he do?</strong></p>
<p>** 18.  The man of  Knowledge,  though  living  like  an  ordinary  man,  is  contrary  to him.   He sees  neither  concentration nor  distraction nor  defilement  of his own.   **</p>
<p>**19. He who is  beyond existence  and  non-existence, who  is  wise, satisfied, and free from desire, does nothing  even if he may  be  acting in the eyes of the  world. **</p>
<p><strong>20. The wise  one who  lives on happily doing what comes  to him to  be done,  does not  feel  eagerness either  in  activity or  in  inactivity.</strong></p>
<p>**21. Blown  by  the wind of  samskaras, the desireless, independent, free,  and liberated person moves about like a dry leaf. **</p>
<p>**22. There is no  joy or sorrow for one who has transcended  worldly  existence.   Ever with a  serene mind, he lives  like  one  without a body. **</p>
<p>**23. The  wise  man  who  delights  in  the  Self and  whose  mind is calm  and  pure,  has no desire  to  renounce  anything whatsoever,  nor  does he  feel any  loss anywhere. **</p>
<p>**24. Naturally  of a vacant mind and  doing  what comes of itself, the wise one, unlike  an ordinary man, is not affected by  honour  or  dishonour. **</p>
<p>**25. One  who acts in  conformity  with  such  thoughts as “this is done by  the body and not by  me, the pure Self” –- such a one,  even  though  acting, does not act.  **</p>
<p>**26. The  jivanmukta  acts like  one who does not say  that  he  is  acting so; but he  is not therefore, a fool.   Even though in  the  world,  he  is ever happy  and blessed.  **</p>
<p>**27. The wise one who,  weary of  diverse  reasonings, has attained repose, neither thinks nor  knows nor hears  nor sees.   **</p>
<p>**28. As  the wise one  has  no distraction  and does not  practise  meditation, he  is neither an  aspirant for liberation nor is  he  in  bondage. Having known  the  universe to be  a figment even  though he  sees  it, he exists as Brahman  Itself. **</p>
<p>**29. He who  has egoism in  him acts  even though  he  does  not act.  Surely the wise one who is  free from egoism  does not act even though he  acts. **</p>
<p>.[Corrected text]  He who has egoism in him, acts  or  does not act.    The wise one who is free from egoism, cannot be said to do anything or not to do anything. Action or inaction can not be predicated by him.</p>
<p>**30. The mind of the liberated one is neither troubled  nor pleased; it is actionless, motionless, desireless,  and free from  doubts. **</p>
<p>**31. The  mind  of the liberated one does not  exert itself to  be  either meditative  or active; but  it  becomes  meditative  and active  without any  motive. **</p>
<p>**32. A dull-witted person  becomes bewildered  on hearing  the  real truth, but  some sharp-witted man withdraws within  himself  like a  dull person.  **</p>
<p>**33. The  ignorant constantly  practice  of  concentration and  control  of  the mind.   The wise, abiding in  the real Self, like  persons  in deep sleep,  do  not find anything  to be done. **</p>
<p>**34. The ignorant person  does not  attain  peace either by  inaction or action.   The wise one becomes happy  merely by  knowing the Truth. **</p>
<p>Inaction: Shutting in a cave like an owl.</p>
<p>Action: Performing ritual, church going, etc.</p>
<p>**35. In this world  those who  devote  themselves  to  diverse practices,  do  not know the Self, which is  pure, intelligent, beloved, perfect, beyond the universe  and free from any taint.  **</p>
<p>**36. An  ignorant  person does not attain  liberation through repeated  practice  of control of  the mind.  The blessed one through mere  knowledge becomes free  and unaffected by  change.   **</p>
<p>**37. The  ignorant person  does not attain Brahman, for he  desires to  attain  It.  The wise one certainly  realizes the nature  of the  Supreme  Brahman, even without desiring to do  so. **</p>
<p>** 38. Without any support and  eager  for  the attainment of freedom,  the  ignorant only  keep  up the  world.   The wise cut the  very root of  this world which  is the source of all misery. **</p>
<p><strong>39. The fool desires peace through  control of  the mind and so does  not attain  it. The wise one knows the Truth  and is ever of tranquil  mind.</strong></p>
<p>** 40. Where is Self-knowledge  for him  whose  knowledge  depends on the object? The wise do not see this and that  but see the immutable  Self.  **</p>
<p>**41. Where is control of mind for  the deluded one who  strives for  it?   It is indeed always natural with  the wise one who delights in  Self.  **</p>
<p>**42. Some  think  that existence  is,  and  others that nothing is.  Rare is the one who thinks neither and  is thus  calm.   **</p>
<p>**43. Those of dull intellect  think that  the Atman  is pure and One without a  second, but, they  do not know  It and are  unhappy as  long as they live.  **</p>
<p>Intellect: Determination.</p>
<p>** 44. The intellect  of one who  longs  for liberation  cannot  function  without  depending on the  object; but  the  intellect of the liberated one is indeed ever independent and free from  desire.  **</p>
<p>**45. Seeing those tigers  of sense-objects,  the frightened ones, seeking  refuge, at once enter a cave  for  the attainment  of control and  concentration.  **</p>
<p>** 46. Seeing the desireless lion  (man), those  elephants, the sense-objects, quietly take  to their heels, or, if unable  to  run away, serve him  like  flatterers.   **</p>
<p>**47. He who is  free from doubts and  has his mind identified  with the  Self, does not resort to practices of  control as  a means  to  liberation.   Seeing, hearing,  touching, smelling, and eating, he lives happily. **</p>
<p>** 48. Established in  Pure  Knowledge,  and calm  by  the  mere  hearing  of  the  Real,  the wise one does  not see what is proper or  improper action or even inaction. **</p>
<p>**  49. The wise  one  does  freely whatever  comes to  be  done,  whether  good or  evil; for his actions are like those of a  child. **</p>
<p>**  50. Through  freedom one  attains to happiness, through  freedom  to the  highest, through freedom to  tranquillity, and through freedom to  the Supreme State.  **</p>
<p>** 51. All  the modifications of the mind are destroyed when  a man realizes that  he himself is neither the doer nor the  enjoyer.  **</p>
<p>** 52. The  conduct  of  the  wise  one,  which  is  unrestricted  by  motive,  shines,  being free  from  pretence; but not  the affected  calmness of the deluded person  whose mind is attached. **</p>
<p>** 53. The  wise  who  are  free  from mental  projections,  unbound and  of  unfettered intellect, sometimes sport  in  the  midst of  great enjoyments, and sometimes retire  into mountain  caves. **</p>
<p>** 54. No  desire whatsoever springs in the heart of the wise one  on honouring  a person  versed  in  sacred learning, a  god,  a  holy  place,  or  on  seeing  a  woman,  a  king or a beloved  one. **</p>
<p>**  55. The  yogi  is  not at all  perturbed even  when ridiculed and despised by  his servants, sons, wives, daughter’s  sons and other relations. **</p>
<p>** 56. Though pleased he is  not pleased,  though  pained he does not suffer any  pain.   Only  those like  him  understand his wonderful  state.  **</p>
<p>**57. The sense of  duty, indeed, is the world  of  relativity.  It  is transcended by  the wise who realizes himself as all-pervasive, formless, immutable, and untainted. **</p>
<p>**58. One  of dull intellect, even without doing anything, is  ever agitated  by distraction;  but  the skilful one, even doing  his duties, is verily unperturbed.  **</p>
<p>**59. With perfect  equanimity, even in practical life, the wise  one  sits happily, sleeps happily, moves  happily, speaks  happily, and  eats happily. **</p>
<p>** 60. Whoever, by  virtue of  the  realization of  his  own self, does not feel distressed even in practical life like  ordinary people, and remains unagitated, like  a vast lake, with all  his sorrows gone—he shines.**</p>
<p>**  61. With  the  deluded,  even  inaction  becomes action,  and with  the wise,  even action results in the fruit of  inaction. **</p>
<p>**  62. The deluded one  often shows  aversion for  his  possessions. Where is attachment,  where  is aversion for him whose love for the body  has  vanished? **</p>
<p><strong>63. The consciousness of the  deluded  one is always  attached to  thinking and  notthinking.  But the  consciousness of the wise  one, though  attended with thinking  the thinkable,  is of the  nature  of unconsciousness.</strong></p>
<p>Unconsciousness:  Not thinking.</p>
<p>**  64. The wise one who  has  no  motive  in  all his actions, who  moves like  a child and is pure, has  no attachment even  to  the work that is being done by  him. **</p>
<p>**  65. Blessed indeed is that knower of  Self, who  has transcended  the mind, and who, even though  seeing,  hearing, touching, smelling, or  eating, is  the same  under all conditions. **</p>
<p>** 66. Where  is the  world and  where  its  appearance, where is  the  end, and where the  means for  the wise one who  is  ever changeless  like  the firmament?  **</p>
<p>** 67. Glorious is  he who is  free from  all  desires, who  is  the embodiment  of  bliss which is  his own nature, and who is  spontaneously absorbed in  the unconditioned Self. **</p>
<p>** 68. In  short,  the great-souled one who has realized the Truth is  free from  the desire of  enjoyment and liberation and  is devoid  of all  attachment  at all  times  and in all places. **</p>
<p>** 69. What remains to be done by  one who is  Pure Consciousness? He  has renounced phenomenal  existence  which begins  with  mahat  and is manifested through mere  name?**</p>
<p>**  70. The pure one knows for certain that  this universe is the product  of illusion and that  nothing  exists.  The  Imperceptible  Self  is  revealed  to  him,  and  he  naturall. enjoys  peace.  **</p>
<p>**71. Rule  of  conduct, dispassion, renunciation  and  restraint of  the  senses–- what are  these  to one who  is  of the nature  of  Pure effulgence  and  who  does not  perceive any  objective reality? **</p>
<p>** 72. Where is the  bondage or liberation,  joy  or sorrow for  one  who shines as  the Infinite and does  not  perceive relative  existence?   **</p>
<p>**73. Only the illusion of  the world prevails.   The reality of the world vanishes with the knowledge of the Self. The  wise one lives without the feeling  of “I-ness”, and “mine-ness”, and attachment.  **</p>
<p>Maya:  Ideation.</p>
<p>** 74. To  the wise  one who  perceives  the  Self as imperishable and  free from  grief, where is knowledge, where is the universe?  Where is the feeling “I  am  the  body”  or “the  body is  mine”?  **</p>
<p>** 75. No sooner  does  the man of dull  intellect give  up such  practices  as mindcontrol, than  he becomes a prey  to desires and fancies.  **</p>
<p>When you rise above dullness you see that what you are trying to avoid is also your self.  No question of control comes.  You cannot drive away your own self.</p>
<p>**76. Even hearing  the Truth, the man of  dull  intellect does  not give  up  his delusion.  Though, through suppression, he appears  devoid  of mental  activity, a craving  for sense-objects lurks within him. **</p>
<p>Cf.  Gita  Chapter2, Verse 59 [The embodied, through the practice of abstinence (i.e. not giving food to the senses), can deaden the feelings of the senses, but longing still lingers in the heart; all longings drop off when he has seen the Supreme. Ibid.].</p>
<p>**77.   He  whose work has  ceased  with the dawn  of Knowledge,  does not find  any opportunity to  do  or  say anything,  even  though  in  ordinary  people&rsquo;s  eyes he  is doing work. **</p>
<p>** 78. For the wise one who is ever immutable and fearless,  where  is there darkness, where light? Where, moreover, is there  any loss? There  is  nothing whatsoever. **</p>
<p>**79.   Where is patience, where is  discrimination,  and where, even,  is  fearlessness for the  yogin  who is  impersonal  and of indescribable nature?  **</p>
<p>**80. There  is no  heaven,  and there is no  hell; there is  not even  liberation-in-life.   In short, nothing exists in  yogic  consciousness. **</p>
<p>**81. The  wise  one  neither  longs for gain  nor grieves at non-attachment.  His  cool mind  is verily filled with nectar.  **</p>
<p>**82. The desireless one neither praises the calm nor blames  even  the wicked.   Contented  and same in  happiness and misery, he finds nothing to be done. **</p>
<p>**83. This wise  one  neither  abhors birth and  death nor wishes to  perceive the Self.   Free  from joy and sorrow, he  is neither dead  nor alive.  **</p>
<p>**84. Glorious is the life of  the  wise one, free  from  expectation, free from attachment for children, wife,  and  others, free from  desire  for the  object  of  senses, and free from the  care of even his own body.  **</p>
<p>** 85. Contentment ever dwells in the heart  of the wise one who lives on whatever happens  to  come  to  him,  and  who  wanders  about at pleasure, resting  wherever he  is when the sun sets. **</p>
<p>**86. Reposing  on  the  foundation of  his  own  being,  and  completely  transcending birth  and  rebirth, the  great-souled person  does not  cares whether his  body dies  or is born.  **</p>
<p>**87. Blessed  is  the wise  one who stands alone, who is  attached  to nothing,  who  is without  any possession, who  moves freely  and at  pleasure, who is  free  from  the pairs of  opposites,  and  whose doubts have  been rent asunder.  **</p>
<p>**88. Glorious is  the wise  one who is  devoid of the feelings  of  “mine”,  to whom earth, a  stone and  gold are all  the  same,  the  knots  of  whose  heart have been  rent asunder, and who has been purged  of  rajas  and  tamas.  **</p>
<p>**89. Who  is there to  stand  comparison  with  the  liberated  soul  who  has no desire whatsoever at heart,  who  is contented and indifferent to everything? **</p>
<p>**90. Who  but the desireless one knows  not  though knowing, sees  not though seeing, and speaks  not though  speaking? **</p>
<p>**91. Be he  a mendicant or  a king, he excels who is unattached and whose  view of things has been freed  from  the sense  of  good and evil.   **</p>
<p>Sense of good and evil: Pleasant and unpleasant.</p>
<p>**92. Where  is wantonness, where is  restraint,  and where  is determination of  Truth for the  yogin  whose life’s object has  been fulfilled and who is  the  embodiment  of guileless sincerity?    **</p>
<p><strong>93. How and to  whom  can be described  what  is  experienced  within  by one who  is desireless,  whose sorrow  is destroyed,  and  who  is contented with  repose in  the Self?</strong></p>
<p>** 94. Not  asleep, even when sleeping  soundly;  not lying down, even when dreaming; and not awake, even  in the waking  state; such  is  the wise one who  is contented  under  all conditions. **</p>
<p>** 95.  The man of Knowledge  is  devoid  of  thought,  even  when  he  is  engaged  in thought;  he  is  devoid of the sense-organs,  even though  he  has them;  he  is  devoid of intelligence, even though  endowed  with  it;  and  he  is  devoid  of  the  sense  of  ego,  even though possessed of it. **</p>
<p>**84. Glorious is the life of  the  wise one, free  from  expectation, free from attachment for children, wife,  and  others, free from  desire  for the  object  of  senses, and free from the  care of even his own body.  **</p>
<p>** 85. Contentment ever dwells in the heart  of the wise one who lives on whatever happens  to  come  to  him,  and  who  wanders  about at pleasure, resting  wherever he  is when the sun sets. **</p>
<p>**86. Reposing  on  the  foundation of  his  own  being,  and  completely  transcending birth  and  rebirth, the  great-souled person  does not  cares whether his  body dies  or is born.  **</p>
<p>**87. Blessed  is  the wise  one who stands alone, who is  attached  to nothing,  who  is without  any possession, who  moves freely  and at  pleasure, who is  free  from  the pairs of  opposites,  and  whose doubts have  been rent asunder.  **</p>
<p>**88. Glorious is  the wise  one who is  devoid of the feelings  of  “mine”,  to whom earth, a  stone and  gold are all  the  same,  the  knots  of  whose  heart have been  rent asunder, and who has been purged  of  rajas  and  tamas.  **</p>
<p>**89. Who  is there to  stand  comparison  with  the  liberated  soul  who  has no desire whatsoever at heart,  who  is contented and indifferent to everything? **</p>
<p>**90. Who  but the desireless one knows  not  though knowing, sees  not though seeing, and speaks  not though  speaking? **</p>
<p>**91. Be he  a mendicant or  a king, he excels who is unattached and whose  view of things has been freed  from  the sense  of  good and evil.   **</p>
<p>**92. Where  is wantonness, where is  restraint,  and where  is determination of  Truth for the  yogin  whose life’s object has  been fulfilled and who is  the  embodiment  of guileless sincerity?  **</p>
<p>**93. How and to  whom  can be described  what  is  experienced  within  by one who  is desireless,  whose sorrow  is destroyed,  and  who  is contented with  repose in  the Self? **</p>
<p>**94. Not  asleep, even when sleeping  soundly;  not lying down, even when dreaming; and not awake, even  in the waking  state; such  is  the wise one who  is contented  under  all conditions. **</p>
<p>**95.  The man of Knowledge  is  devoid  of  thought,  even  when  he  is  engaged  in thought;  he  is  devoid of the sense-organs,  even though  he  has them;  he  is  devoid of intelligence, even though  endowed  with  it;  and  he  is  devoid  of  the  sense  of  ego,  even though possessed of it. **</p>
<p>**96. The  man of  Knowledge is neither happy nor miserable, neither attached nor unattached, neither liberated nor  an aspirant for liberation, he  is  neither this  nor that.  **</p>
<p>**97. The  blessed one is not distracted  even  in distraction; he is  not meditative even in  meditation; he is  not dull even  in a state  of dullness; and he is  not  learned even though possessed of learning.   **</p>
<p>**98. The liberated  one  who  abides  in  the Self  under  all  conditions,  who  is  free from the idea of action  and  of  duty,  and who is the  same  everywhere,  does  not, owing to desirelessness, reflect upon what  he has or  has not done.  **</p>
<p>**99. Praised, the  wise one  does  not feel pleased;  and blamed,  he  does  not  feel annoyed. He neither  rejoices  in life nor fears death. **</p>
<p>**100.  The  tranquil-minded one seeks  neither  the  crowded place nor  the  wilderness.   He remains  the same under any conditions and  in any  place.  **</p>
