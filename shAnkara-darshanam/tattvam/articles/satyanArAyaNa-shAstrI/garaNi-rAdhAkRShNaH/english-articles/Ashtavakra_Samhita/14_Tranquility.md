title = "14: Tranquility"

** Janaka said:**

** 14.1 Though  appearing  asleep  like other men, one  whose interest in the world  is  exhausted, whose mind has been emptied, who thinks only  by  inadvertence, is  in  Reality  awake.**

BLISS TESTED

Emptied of (worldly) thoughts:  Necessary at one stage. Awake though asleep: Even when you see a second thing, your mind does not take it as real.

** 14.2 When desire has melted, how can there be wealth, or friends, or the seduction of senses? What use is scripture and knowledge?**

** 14.3 I have realized the Supreme Self, the Witness, the  One. I am indifferent to bondage and freedom. I  have no need for liberation. **

Nobody has seen a God except in imagination.  The true God is the [S] Drik.

**14.4 The inner condition of one who is  devoid of doubt yet moves among creatures of illusion can only be known by  those  like him.**

The [S] Jnani knows all is Brahman.  No second thing and hence, no doubt.
