**Ashtavakra said: **

**11.1 Existence, non-existence, change-- this is the nature of things. Realizing this, stillness, serenity and bliss naturally follow. **

WISDOM IN LIFE

The point is appearance, disappearance, change—they necessarily come and necessarily happen.  You cannot prevent them.  This chapter shows how you can pacify your mind, seeing that events are not in your control. Pain: Not a happy translation.

[The word] [S] klesha also refers to mental suffering.

**11.2 One who knows for certain that “Self  creates All  and  is  alone” becomes still, desireless, unattached.**

The religious attitude.

** 11.3 One who knows for certain that adversity and success come and go  in obedience to destiny becomes  content. He  neither desires nor grieves.**

Fate: That which is unknown to us and upon which we have no control.

**11.4 One who knows for certain that  birth and  death,  happiness and misery, come and go in obedience to destiny sees nothing to  accomplish. He  engages  in non-action, and in action remains unattached. **

**11.5 One who has realized that only by caring is misery caused in the world becomes free,  happy, serene, desireless.**

** 11.6 “I am not the body,  nor is the body my possession— I am Awareness itself.” One who realizes this  for certain has no memory of things done or left undone. There is only the Absolute.**

**11.7 “From Brahma  to the  last  blade of grass-- I alone  exist.” One who  knows this  for certain becomes immaculate, serene, unconflicted. Attainment has no meaning. **

**11.8 One who knows for certain that  this manifold and wonderful universe is nothing becomes desireless Awareness and abides in the stillness of  No-thing.**

As if nothing exists: Not separate from me. Manifoldness and wonder are fictions of the mind resulting from its causal instinct.-  Shyamlatal, June 6, 1942 [A quote from Swami Virajananda while in that Himalayan retreat].
