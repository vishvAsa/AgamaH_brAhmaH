SARVASAARA UPANISHAD

AND

NIRALAMBA UPANISHAD

COMPILATION

RADHAKRISHNAN GARANI



Sarvasaara upanishad and Niralamba Upanishad have been classified under twenty four ordinary Upanishads.

These two contain the vedantic terminology and are like a dictionary of  vedantic  terms used in the Upanishads.

Sarvasaara upanishad belongs to the Atharvaveda.

Although this appears in Krishna yajurveda also,  their differences seem to be very small.  TWENTY three different aspects of the Vedic terminology has been explained in this Upanishad.

Niralamba Upanishad belongs to the Shukla yajurveda.. This has  forty one Vedic terminology.

But the explanations  given in both differ in their content and context.

Not Much is known about the Rishis who wrote this and also the period in which they were written.   In all probability this was written during the time when muktika upanishad was in vogue.

I have created these using the help of many writers to whom I am deeply indebted.

The purpose of taking up this task is  to help a mumukshu to get a grip on the vedantic terms.  This is, in my opinion a very good for one who takes up serious saadhana

The reader hopefully gets all the benefits out of this

समस्तवेदान्तसारसिद्धान्तार्थकलेवरम् ।

विकलेवरकैवल्यं रामचन्द्रपदं भजे ॥

I  bow at the feet of Sri Ramachandra who has enabled me to assimilate the essence of the entire vedantic truths  about the  existence of an awareness which has no adjunct whatsoever.

सर्वसारं निरालम्बं रहस्यं वज्रसूचिकम् ।

तेजोनादध्यानविद्यायोगतत्त्वात्मबोधकम् ॥

This **upadesha** of the "Atman"  which is highly secretive and sharp like a diamond,  is meant for an aspirant  to give him the necessary capability  to study "THAT"  very shining light of awareness.

ॐ सह नाववतु ॥ सह नौ भुनक्तु ॥ सह वीर्यं करवावहै ॥

तेजस्विनावधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहै ॥

ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

Om! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;

May we work conjointly with great energy,

May our study be vigorous and effective;

May we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).

Om! Let there be Peace in me!

Let there be Peace in my environment!

Let there be Peace in the forces that act on me!

कथं बन्धः कथं मोक्षः का विद्या काऽविद्येति ।

जाग्रत्स्वप्नसुषुप्तितुरीयं च कथम्।

अन्नमयप्राणमयमनोमयविज्ञानमयानन्दमयकोशाः कथम् ।

कर्ता जीवः पञ्चवर्गः क्षेत्रज्ञः साक्षी कूटस्थोऽन्तर्यामी कथम् ।

प्रत्यगात्मा परात्मा माया चेति कथम् ।

1. Om. What is Bandha (bondage of the Soul) ?

What is Moksha (liberation) ?

What is Avidya (nescience) ?

What is Vidya (knowledge) ?

What are the states of Jagrat (waking), Svapna (dreaming), Sushupti (Dreamless sleep), and the fourth,Turiya (Absolute) ?

What are the Annamaya, Pranamaya, Manomaya,Vijnanamaya and Anand maya Koshas (vestures or sheaths of the soul) ?

What is Karta (agent),

what is Jiva (individual self),

What  is  Kshetrajna (knower of the body)?

What is  Sakshi(Witness), the Kutastha?

What  is  Antaryamin (Internal Ruler) ?

What is this Pratyagatman (Inner Self), what is  Paramatman (Supreme Self), the Atman, and also Maya ? --

**The Rishi answers**

The master of Self looks upon the body and such like things other than the Self as Itself: this egoism is the bondage

( **बन्धः**)  of the soul.

The cessation of that (egoism) is _Moksha_,; **मोक्षः** liberation.

That which causes that egoism is _Avidya_, nescience. **आविद्य**

That by which this egoism is completely turned back is _Vidya, **विद्या**_ knowledge.

When the self, by means of its four and ten organs of sense beginning with the mind and benignly influenced by the sun and the rest which appear outside, perceives gross objects such as sound etc., then it is the Atman's _Jaagrat_ **जाग्रत्** (wakeful) state.

When, even in the absence of sound etc., (the self) not divested of desire for them, experiences, by means of the four organs, sound and the rest in the form of desires - then it is the Atman's state of _Svapna_ **स्वप्न** (dream).

When the four and ten organs cease from activity, and there is the absence of differentiated knowledge, then is the Atman's state of _Sushupti_ **सुषुप्ति** (dreamless sleep).

अवस्थात्रयभावाभावसाक्षी स्वयंभावरहितं

नैरन्तर्यं चैतन्यं यदा तदा तुरीयं चैतन्यमित्युच्यते ।

2. When the essence of consciousness which manifests itself as the three states, is a witness of the states, (but is) itself devoid of states, positive or negative, and remains in the state of non-separation and oneness, then it is spoken of as the _Turiya_, **तुरीय** the fourth.

अन्नकार्याणां कोशानां समूहोऽन्नमयः कोश उच्यते ।

The aggregate of the six sheaths, which are the products of food, is called the **_Annamaya-kosha_,** alimentary sheath.

प्राणादिचतुर्दशवायुभेदा अन्नमयकोशे यदा वर्तन्ते

तदा प्राणमयः कोश इत्युच्यते ।

When the fourteen kinds of _Vaayus_ beginning with the _Praana_, are in the alimentary sheath, then it is spoken of as the **_Pranamaya-kosha_**,

एतत्कोशद्वयसंसक्तं मन आदि चतुर्दशकरणैरात्मा

शब्दादिविषयसङ्कल्पादीन्धर्मान्यदा करोति तदा मनोमयः  कोश इत्युच्यते

vesture of the vital airs.

When the Atman united with these two sheaths performs, by means of the four organs beginning with the mind, the functions of desire, etc., which have for their objects sound and the rest, then it (this state) is called the **_Manomaya_- _kosha_**, mental sheath.

एतत्कोशत्रयसंसक्तं तद्गतविशेषज्ञो

यदा भासते तदा विज्ञानमयः कोश इत्युच्यते ।

When the soul shines being united with these three sheaths, and cognisant of the differences and non-differences thereof then it is called the **_Vijnanamaya-kosha_**,

sheath of intelligence

एतत्कोशचतुष्टयं संसक्तं स्वकारणाज्ञाने

वटकणिकायामिव वृक्षो यदा वर्तते तदानन्दमयः कोश

इत्युच्यते ।

When these four sheaths remain in their own cause which is Knowledge (Brahman), in the same way as the latent Banyan tree remains in the Banyan seed, then it is spoken of as the **_Anandamaya_ -_kosha_,** causal frame of the Soul.

सुखदुःखबुद्ध्या श्रेयोऽन्तः कर्ता

When it dwells in the body, as the seat of the idea of pleasure and pain, then it is the **_Karta_**, agent.

यदा तदा

इष्टविषये बुद्धिः सुखबुद्धिरनिष्टविषये बुद्धिर्दुःखबुद्धिः

शब्दस्पर्शरूपरसगन्धाः सुखदुःखहेतवः ।

पुण्यपापकर्मानुसारी भूत्वा प्राप्तशरीरसंयोग-

मप्राप्तशरीरसंयोगमिव कुर्वाणो यदा दृश्यते

तदोपहितजीव इत्युच्यते ।

The idea of pleasure is that which pertains to wished-for objects, and the idea of pain is that which pertains to undesirable objects. Sound, touch, sight, taste, and smell are the causes of pleasure and pain. When the soul, conforming itself to good and bad actions, has made a link of the present body (with its past body), and is seen to be effecting a union, a connection as it were, with the body not yet received, then it is called the **_Jiva_**, individual soul, on account of its being limited by Upadhis.

मन आदिश्च प्राणादिश्चेच्छादिश्च सत्त्वादिश्च पुण्यादिश्चैते

पञ्चवर्गा इत्येतेषां पञ्चवर्गाणां ।

The **five groups** are those beginning with the mind, those beginning with the Prana, those beginning with the _Sattva_, those beginning with the will, and those beginning with merit.

धर्मीभूतात्मा ज्ञानादृते न विनश्यत्यात्मसन्निधौ नित्यत्वेन  प्रतीयमान आत्मोपाधिर्यस्तल्लिङ्गशरीरं

हृद्ग्रन्थिरित्युच्यते ।

The ego possessing the attributes of these five groups, does not die out without the knowledge of the ever-attained Self. That which, owing to its proximity to the Self, appears as imperishable and is attributed to Atman, is called the Linga-sharira (subtle body), and the "**_heart's knot_".**

तत्र यत्प्रकाशते चैतन्यं स क्षेत्रज्ञ इत्युच्यते ।

The Consciousness which manifests itself therein is called the **_Kshetrajna_**, Knower of the Kshetra (body).

ज्ञातृज्ञानज्ञेयानामाविर्भाव-

तिरोभावज्ञाता स्वयमाविर्भावतिरोभावरहितः

स्वयंज्योतिः साक्षीत्युच्यते ।

3. He who is the cogniser of the manifestation and disappearance of the knower, knowledge, and the knowable, but is 1himself devoid of such manifestation and disappearance, and is self-luminous, is called the **_Saakshi_**, Witness.

ब्रह्मादिपिपीलिकापर्यन्तं सर्वप्राणिबुद्धिष्ववशिष्टत-

योपलभ्यमानः सर्वप्राणिबुद्धिस्थो यदा तदा कूटस्थ

इत्युच्यते ।

When being perceived in an undifferentiated manner in the intelligence of all beings, from Brahma (the Creator) down to an ant, it resides in the intelligence of all beings, then it is called the **_Kutastha_**.

कूटस्थोपहितभेदानां स्वरूपलाभहेतुर्भूत्वा

मणिगणे सूत्रमिव सर्वक्षेत्रेष्वनुस्यूतत्वेन यदा काश्यते

आत्मा तदान्तर्यामीत्युच्यते ।

When, standing as the means of realising the real nature of the Kutastha and others, which are differentiations by virtue of possessing limiting adjuncts, the Atman manifests itself as inter-woven in all bodies, like the thread through a string of jewels, then it is called the **_Antaryamin_**,  Internal Ruler.

त्वंपदार्थादौपाधिकात्तत्पदार्थादौपाधिक-

भेदाद्विलक्षणमाकाशवत्सूक्ष्मं केवलसत्ता-

मात्रस्वभावं परं ब्रह्मेत्युच्यते ।

When the Atman shines forth - absolutely free from all limiting adjuncts, brilliant, as a homogeneous mass of consciousness in its nature of pure Intelligence, independent - then, it is spoken of as the Entity of "Thou" (Tvam), and as the **_Pratyagaatman_**, Inner-Self.

सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म । (That which is) Satya (the Reality), Jnana (Knowledge), Ananta (the Infinite), Ananda (Bliss), is **_Brahman_**.

सत्यमविनाशि ।

The Reality is the indestructible;

अविनाशि  नाम देशकालवस्तुनिमित्तेषु विनश्यत्सु यन्न विनश्यति  तदविनाशि

That .which, when name, space, time, substance, and causation are destroyed, dies not, is the indestructible; and that is called **Satya, **the Reality.

ज्ञानं नामोत्पत्तिविनाशरहितं नैरन्तर्यं

चैतन्यं ज्ञानमुच्यते।

And Jnana - that essence of Intelligence which has no beginning and no end, spoken of as **Jnaana**.

अनन्तं नाम मृद्विकारेषु

मृदिव स्वर्णविकारेषु स्वर्णमिव तन्तुविकारेषु

तन्तुरिवाव्यक्तादिसृष्टिप्रपञ्चेषु पूर्णं व्यापकं

चैतन्यमनन्तमित्युच्यते ।

4. And **_Ananta_**, the Infinite, (remaining in the same manner) as (does) clay in modifications of clay, as gold in modifications of gold, as thread in fabrics of thread, the antecedent, all-pervading Consciousness, that is in all phenomena of creation beginning with the Unmanifested, **is called the Infinite. **

आनन्दं नाम सुखचैतन्यस्वरूपोऽपरिमितानन्द-

समुद्रोऽवशिष्टसुखस्वरूपश्चानन्द इत्युच्यते

And **_Ananda_**, Bliss - the essence of the consciousness of happiness, the ocean of measureless bliss, and the state of undifferentiated happiness is called Bliss.

एतद्वस्तुचतुष्टयं यस्य लक्षणं देशकाल-

वस्तुनिमित्तेश्वव्यभिचारी तत्पदार्थः परमात्मेत्युच्यते ।

That, of which the above fourfold nature is an indication, and which is permanent in all space, time, substance, and causation, is called the Entity of "That" (Tat) **_Paramatman_**, Supreme Self, and Para-Brahman, or the Highest Brahman.

त्वंपदार्थादौपाधिकात्तत्पदार्थादौपाधिक-

भेदाद्विलक्षणमाकाशवत्सूक्ष्मं केवलसत्ता-

मात्रस्वभावं परं ब्रह्मेत्युच्यते ।

Distinguished from the Entity of "Thou" (when it appears to be) possessed of attributes, as well as from the Entity of "That" (when it appears to be) possessed of attributes, that which is all-pervading like the sky, subtle, whole by itself, pure Existence, the Entity of "Art" (Asi). Self-luminous, is spoken of as the **_Atman_**; the Entity of "not-That", also is spoken of as Atman.

माया नाम   अनादिरन्तवती प्रमाणा

अप्रमाणसाधारणा न सती नासती न सदसती स्वयमधिका विकाररहिता निरूप्यमाणा

सतीतरलक्षणशून्या सा मायेत्युच्यते

That which is beginningless, fruitful, open to both proof and disproof, neither real nor unreal, nor real-unreal - non-existent, when, because of the immutability of its own substratum, the cause of change is ascertained; -- existent when it is not so ascertained - (thus that) which is undefinable, is called **_Maaya._**

अज्ञानं

तुच्छाप्यसती कालत्रयेऽपि पामराणां वास्तवी च

सत्त्वबुद्धिर्लौकिकानामिदमित्थमित्यनिर्वचनीया वक्तुं न शक्यते ।

For those who are steeped in ignorance,who always think and dwell in the past, present and future,who think that the world they live in, is only the real one and think they are always  right, this UPADESHA should  never be given, since it does not work.

नाहं भवाम्यहं देवो नेन्द्रियाणि दशैव तु ।

न बुद्धिर्न मनः शश्वन्नाहङ्कारस्तथैव च ॥ १

I am neither the body nor the ten senses, Buddhi, Mind, Ego. Without Prana and mind, pure,  I am always the witness, pure consciousness, surely.

नाहं कर्ता नैव भोक्ता प्रकृतेः साक्षिरूपकः

I am neither the doer nor the enjoyer, only a witness to Prakriti.

मत्सान्निध्यात्प्रवर्तन्ते देहाद्या अजडा इव ॥ ३॥

By my presence, body etc., function as alive, still, eternal, ever joy, pure.

ब्रह्मैवाहं सर्ववेदान्तवेद्यं

      नाहं वेद्यं व्योमवातादिरूपम् ।

रूपं नाहं नाम नाहं न कर्म

      ब्रह्मैवाहं सच्चिदानन्दरूपम् ॥

I am Brahman to be known from all Vedanta, yet unknowable like sky and air. I am neither form nor action, only Brahman.

नाहं कर्ता नैव भोक्ता प्रकृतेः साक्षिरूपकः ।

मत्सान्निध्यात्प्रवर्तन्ते देहाद्या अजडा इव ॥ ३॥

I am not a body; birth, death do not come to me. I am not Prana - have no hunger and thirst; I am not mind - have no grief or delusion. I am not the doer - have no bondage or release.

अप्राणो ह्यमनाः शुभ्रो बुद्ध्यादीनां हि सर्वदा ।

साक्ष्यहं सर्वदा नित्यश्चिन्मात्रोऽहं न संशयः ॥ २॥I

I am Brahman to be known from all Vedanta, yet unknowable like sky and air. I am neither form nor action, only Brahman.

इत्युपनिषत् ॥

ॐ सह नाववतु ॥ सह नौ भुनक्तु ॥ सह वीर्यं करवावहै ॥

तेजस्विनावधीतमस्तु मा विद्विषावहै ॥

Om! May He protect us both together; may He nourish us both together;

May we work conjointly with great energy,

May our study be vigorous and effective;

May we not mutually dispute (or may we not hate any).

Om! Let there be Peace in me!

Let there be Peace in my environment!

Let there be Peace in the forces that act on me!

Here ends the Sarva-Sara Upanishad, as contained in the Krishna-Yajur-Veda.



Swami Madhavananda. Advaita Ashram, Kolkatta. "Sarva Sara Upanishad




## Niralamba Upanishad

यत्रालम्बालम्बिभावो विद्यते न कदाचन ।

ज्ञविज्ञसम्यग्ज्ञालम्बं निरालम्बं हरिं भजे ॥

To that  chaitanya called HARI, who appears as both karma and jnaana,,who is devoid of upadhis, full of energy,having neither  beginning nor end, free from all gunas,peaceful indescribable, I offer my prayers.

ॐ नमः शिवाय गुरवे सच्चिदानन्द मूर्तये ।

निष्प्रपञ्चाय शान्ताय निरालम्बाय तेजसे ॥

To ISHWARA who is  the embodiment of sat chit ananda swaroopa, who is unattached to the world, peaceful, having no adjuncts, I bow my head to such a guru

ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते ।

पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥

ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

Om ! That (Brahman) is infinite, and this (universe) is infinite.

The infinite proceeds from the infinite.

(Then) taking the infinitude of the infinite (universe),

It remains as the infinite (Brahman) alone.

Om ! Let there be Peace in me !

Let there be Peace in my environment !

Let there be Peace in the forces that act on me !



निरालम्बं समाश्रित्य सालम्बं विजहाति यः ।

स संन्यासी च योगी च कैवल्यं पदमश्नुते ।

A person, who having detached himself from all the worldly activities and taken complete refuge in that CHAITANYA which is devoid of upadhis, is a true Sanyasi and a  Yogi.  Such a person is only competent  to attain  kaivalya pada.

एषमज्ञानजन्तूनां समस्तारिष्टशान्तये ।

यद्यद्बोद्धव्यमखिलं तदाशङ्क्य ब्रवीम्यहम् ॥

**ब्रह्म इति च**

महदहङ्कारपृथिव्यप्तेजोवाय्वाकाशत्वेन

तत्सकलशक्त्युपबृंहितमनाद्यनन्तं

शुद्धं शिवं शान्तं निर्गुणमित्यादि-

वाच्यमनिर्वाच्यं चैतन्यं ब्रह्म ॥

(1) Brahman is the ineffable Spirit. It appears as the Mahat (the Sankhyan Great), the ego, (the elements) earth, water, fire, air and ether – the macrocosm and as actions, knowledge and ends. It is non-dual and free from all adjuncts. It is big with all powers and is without beginning and end. It may be spoken of as pure, good, quiescent, unqualified.

**ईश्वर इति च**

ब्रह्मैव स्वशक्तिं प्रकृत्यभिधेयामाश्रित्य

लोकान्सृष्ट्वा प्रविश्यान्तर्यामित्वेन ब्रह्मादीनां

बुद्धीन्द्रियनियन्तृत्वादीश्वरः ॥

2) God is the veritable Brahman that, depending on Its power called Prakriti creates the worlds and enters (into them) as the inner Controller of Brahma, 0etc., (He) is Ishvara, as He controls the intellect and the sense-organs.



**जीव इति च**

ब्रह्मविष्ण्वीशानेन्द्रादीनां नामरूपद्वारा

स्थूलोऽहमिति मिथ्याध्यासवशाज्जीवः ।सोऽहमेकोऽपि

देहारम्भकभेदवशाद्बहुजीवः ।

3) The living being (Jiva) is he who, through false superimposition, affirms ‘I am gross’ due to ‘the name and form’ of Brahma, Vishnu, Isana, Indra, etc. (Jiva thinks): Though I am one, due to the differences of the causes that originate the body, the Jivas are many.

**प्रकृतिरिति च**

ब्रह्मणः सकाशान्नानाविचित्रजगन्निर्माण-

सामार्थ्यबुद्धिरूपा ब्रह्मशक्तिरेव प्रकृतिः ।

(4) Prakriti is but the power of Brahman; it is intellectual in nature and competent to create the variegated and marvelous world from (the matrix) of Brahman.



**परमात्मेति च**

देहादेः परतरत्वद्ब्राह्मैव  परमात्मा

5) The supreme Self is Brahman alone being altogether different from the body, etc.

स ब्रह्मा स विष्णुः स इन्द्रः स शमनः स सूर्यः

स चन्द्रस्ते सुरास्ते असुरास्ते पिशाचास्ते मनुष्यास्ताः

स्त्रियस्ते पश्वादयस्तत्स्थावरं ते ब्राह्मणादयः ।

सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म नेह नानास्ति किञ्चन

6-20) Brahma, Vishnu, Indra, (the god of) Death, the Sun, the Moon, the gods, the demons, men, women, animals, etc.; the immobile the Brahmanas, etc.; are that very Spirit.

**जातिरिति च **

न चर्मणो न रक्तस्य न मांसस्य न चास्थिनः ।

न जातिरात्मनो जातिर्व्यवहारप्रकल्पिता ।

21) Neither skin nor blood nor flesh nor bone has caste; To self is caste ascribed through mere usage.

**कर्मेति च**

क्रियमाणेन्द्रियैः कर्मण्यहं करोमीत्यध्यात्मनिष्ठतया

कृतं कर्मैव कर्म ।

22) ‘I do the deeds that are done through sense-organs’ – the deed thus done as centred in the Self alone is the deed (in question).

**अकर्मेति च**

कर्तृत्वभोक्तृत्वा-द्यहङ्कारतया बन्धरूपं जन्मादिकारणं

नित्यनैमित्तिकयागव्रततपोदानादिषु फलाभिसन्धानं

यत्तदकर्म ।

23) The deed done with conceit as agent and enjoyer, causing birth, etc., binds; The non-deed is the obligatory and occasional action – sacrifice, holy vow, austerity, gifts, etc., done without desire for their fruit.

**ज्ञानमिति च**

देहेन्द्रियनिग्रहसद्गुरूपासन-

श्रवणमनननिदिध्यासनैर्यद्यदृग्दृश्यस्वरूपं

सर्वान्तरस्थं सर्वसमं घटपटादिपदार्थ-

मिवाविकारं विकारेषु चैतन्यं विना किञ्चिन्नास्तीति

साक्षात्कारानुभवो ज्ञानम् ।

24) Knowledge is the immediate realization, due to the disciplining of body and sense-organs, service rendered to the Teacher, hearing, thinking and meditation, that there is nothing but Spirit, the essence of both subjects and objects, which is immutable among the mutables like pots and clothes, the same in all, their innermost (essence).

**अज्ञानमिति च**

रज्जौ सर्पभ्रान्तिरिवाद्वितीये सर्वानुस्यूते सर्वमये

ब्रह्मणि देवतिर्यङ्नरस्थावरस्त्रीपुरुषवर्णाश्रम-

बन्धमोक्षोपाधिनानात्मभेदकल्पित ज्ञानमज्ञानम्

25) Ignorance is the illusory knowledge – like that of the snake in the rope – of Brahman that is All in all, all-pervasive and non-dual. (This illusory knowledge) is associated with a plurality of selves based on the plurality of the adjuncts of bondage and liberation, viz.; stations in life, castes, men, women, the immobiles, mankind, (lower) animals and gods.

**सुखमिति च**

सच्चिदानन्दस्वरूपं ज्ञात्वानन्दरूपा

या स्थितिः सैव सुखम् ।

26) Pleasure is the blissful state that succeeds the knowledge of the essence of Being, Intelligence and Bliss.

**दुःखमिति च**

अनात्मरूपः   विषयसङ्कल्प एव दुःखम्

27)  (Dukha - pain) is the mere Sankalpa (or the thinking) of the objects of mundane existence (or of not-Self).

**स्वर्ग इति च **

सत्संसर्गः.  स्वर्गः ।

28) Heaven is the association with the holy.

**नरक इति च**

असत्संसारविषयजनसंसर्ग एव   नरकः ।

29) Association with the worldly folk who are unholy alone is hell.

**बन्ध इति च**

अनाद्यविद्यावासनया जातोऽहमि-

त्यादिसङ्कल्पो बन्धः ।

30)  Bondage consists in imagining due to the beginningless latent impressions of nescience, ‘I am born, etc.’

पितृमातृसहोदरदारापत्य-.  गृहारामक्षेत्रममता संसारावरणसङ्कल्पो बन्धः ।

30 a)  Bondage consists in imagining a plunge into the flux of existence with its possessive claims on fields, gardens, houses, children, wives, brothers, mothers and fathers.
