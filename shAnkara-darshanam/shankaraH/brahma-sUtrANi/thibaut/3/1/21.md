21. The third term comprises that which springs from heat.

The third term in the scriptural passage quoted, i.e. 'that which springs from a germ,' must be understood as implying those beings also which spring from heat; the two classes having in common that they spring from earth or water, i.e. from something stable. Different from their origin is the origin of those beings which spring from moving things (viz. animals).--In other places the beings springing from heat and those springing from germs are spoken of as constituting separate classes.--Hence there is no contradiction.
