47. But (the agnis rather constitute) a vidy훮, on account of the assertion (made by the text).

The word 'but' sets aside the p큰rvapaksha.

The agnis built of mind and so on are to be viewed not as complementary to a sacrificial action, but as independent and constituting a vidy훮 of their own. For the text expressly asserts that 'they are built of knowledge (vidy훮) only,' and that 'by knowledge they are built for him who thus knows.'
