25. For this very reason there is no need of the lighting of the fire and so on.

The expression 'For this very same reason' must be viewed as taking up Sutra III, 4, 1, because thus a satisfactory sense is established. For this very same reason, i.e. because knowledge subserves the purpose of man, the lighting of the sacrificial fire and similar works which are enjoined on the different āśramas are not to be observed, since man's purpose is effected through knowledge.

The Sūtrakāra thus sums up the result of the first adhikaraṇa, intending to make some further remarks.
