35. And scripture also declares that (those performing works) are not overpowered (by passion and the like).

This Sūtra points out a further indicatory mark fortifying the conclusion that works co-operate towards knowledge. Scripture also shows that he who is furnished with such means as Brahmacarya, &c., is not overpowered by such afflictions as passion and the like. Compare the passage, 'That Self does not perish which they find out by Brahmacarya' (Cḥ. Up. VIII,,";, 3).

It is thus a settled conclusion that sacrifices and so on are works incumbent on the āśramas as well as co-operative towards knowledge.
