30. And this is said in Smr̥ti also.

That in cases of need both he who knows and he who does not know may eat any food Smr̥ti also states; compare e.g. 'He who being in danger of his life eats food from anywhere is stained by sin no more than the lotus leaf by water.'--On the other hand, many passages teach that unlawful food is to be avoided. 'Intoxicating liquor the Brāhmaṇa must permanently forego;' 'Let them pour boiling spirits down the throat of the Brāhmaṇa who drinks spirits;' 'Spirit-drinking worms grow in the

mouth of the spirit-drinking man, because he enjoys what is unlawful.'
