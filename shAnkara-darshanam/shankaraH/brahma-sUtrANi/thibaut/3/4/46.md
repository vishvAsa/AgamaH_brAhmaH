46. And on account of scriptural statement.

'Whatever blessing the priests pray for at the sacrifice, they pray for the good of the sacrificer; thus he said' (Śat. Brā. I, 3, 1, 26); 'Therefore an udgātr̥ who knows this may say: what wish shall I obtain for you by my singing?' (Cḥ. Up. I, 7, 8). These scriptural passages also declare that the fruit of meditations in which the priest is the agent goes to the sacrificer.

All this establishes the conclusion that the meditations on subordinate parts of the sacrifice are the work of the priest.
