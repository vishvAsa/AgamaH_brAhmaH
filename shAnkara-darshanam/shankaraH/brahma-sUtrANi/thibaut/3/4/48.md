48. On account of his being all, however, there is winding up with the householder.

The word 'however' is meant to lay stress on the householder's being everything. For the performance of many works belonging to his own āśrama, such as sacrifices and the like, which involve not a little trouble, is enjoined on him by scripture; and at the same time the duties of the other āśramas--such as tenderness for all living creatures, restraint of the senses and so on--are incumbent on him also as far as circumstances allow. There is therefore nothing contradictory

in the Cḥāndogya winding up with the householder.
