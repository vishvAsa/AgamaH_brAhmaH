In spite of this it is on the part of man a natural [^fn_39] procedure-- which has its cause in wrong knowledge--not to distinguish the two entities (object and subject) and their respective attributes, although they are absolutely distinct, but to superimpose upon each the characteristic nature and the attributes of the other, and thus, coupling the Real and the Unreal [^fn_40], to make use of expressions such as 'That am I,' 'That is mine [^fn_41].'


[^fn_39]: 3:4 Natural, i.e. original, beginngless; for the modes of speech p. 4 and action which characterise transmigratory existence have existed, with the latter, from all eternity.





But what have we to understand by the term 'superimposition?'

The apparent presentation, in the form of remembrance, to consciousness of something previously observed, in some other thing [^fn_42]. Some indeed define the term 'superimposition' as the superimposition of the attributes of one thing on another thing [^fn_43]. Others, again, define superimposition as the error

[^fn_40]: 4:1 I.e. the intelligent Self which is the only reality and the non-real objects, viz. body and so on, which are the product of wrong knowledge.

[^fn_41]: 4:2 'The body, &c. is my Self;' 'sickness, death, children, wealth, &c., belong to my Self.'

[^fn_42]: 4:3 Literally 'in some other place.' The clause 'in the form of remembrance' is added, the Bhāmatī remarks, in order to exclude those cases where something previously observed is recognised in some other thing or place; as when, for instance, the generic character of a cow which was previously observed in a black cow again presents itself to consciousness in a grey cow, or when Devadatta whom we first saw in Pāṭaliputra again appears before us in Māhishmatī. These are cases of recognition where the object previously observed again presents itself to our senses; while in mere remembrance the object previously perceived is not in renewed contact with the senses. Mere remembrance operates in the case of adhyāsa, as when we mistake mother-of-pearl for silver which is at the time not present but remembered only.

[^fn_43]: 4:4 The so-called anyathākhyātivādins maintain that in the act of adhyāsa the attributes of one thing, silver for instance, are superimposed on a different thing existing in a different place, mother-of-pearl for instance (if we take for our example of adhyāsa the case of some man mistaking a piece of mother-of-pearl before him for a piece of silver). The ātmakhyātivādins maintain that in adhyāsa the modification, in the form of silver, of the internal organ and action which characterise transmigratory existence have existed, with the latter, from all eternity.p. 5 is superimposed on the external thing mother-of-pearl and thus itself appears external. Both views fall under the above definition.

founded on the non-apprehension of the difference of that which is superimposed from that on which it is superimposed [^fn_44]. Others [^fn_45], again, define it as the fictitious assumption of attributes contrary to the nature of that thing on which something else is superimposed. But all these definitions agree in so far as they represent superimposition as the apparent presentation of the attributes of one thing in another thing. And therewith agrees also the popular view which is exemplified by expressions such as the following: 'Mother-of-pearl appears like silver,' 'The moon although one only appears as if she were double.' But how is it possible that on the interior Self which itself is not an object there should be superimposed objects and their attributes? For every one superimposes an object only on such other objects as are placed before him (i.e. in contact with his sense-organs), and you have said before that the interior Self which is entirely disconnected from the idea of the Thou (the Non-Ego) is never an object. It is not, we reply, non-object in the absolute sense. For it is the object of the notion of the Ego [^fn_46], and the interior Self is well known to exist on account of its immediate (intuitive) presentation. [^fn_47] Nor is it an exceptionless rule that objects

[^fn_44]: 5:1 This is the definition of the akhyātivādins.

[^fn_45]: 5:2 Some anyathākhyātivādins and the Mādhyamikas according to Ānanda Giri.

[^fn_46]: 5:3 The pratyagātman is in reality non-object, for it is svayamprakāśa, self-luminous, i.e. the subjective factor in all cognition. But it becomes the object of the idea of the Ego in so far as it is limited, conditioned by its adjuncts which are the product of Nescience, viz. the internal organ, the senses and the subtle and gross bodies, i. e. in so far as it is jīva, individual or personal soul. Cp. Bhāmatī, pp. 22, 23: 'cidātmaiva svayamprakāśos#pi buddhyādivishayavi_kkh_uraṇāt kathaṁcid asmatpratyayavishayos#haṁkārāspadaṁ gīva iti ca jantur iti ca kshetrajña iti cākhyāyate.'

[^fn_47]: 5:4 Translated according to the Bhāmatī. We deny, the objector says, the possibility of adhyāsa in the case of the Self, not on the ground that it is not an object because self-luminous (for that it p. 6 may be an object although it is self-luminous you have shown), but on the ground that it is not an object because it is not manifested either by itself or by anything else.

It is known or manifest, the Vedāntin replies, on account of its immediate presentation (aparokshatvāt), i.e. on account of the intuitional knowledge we have of it. Ānanda Giri construes the above clause in a different way: asmatpratyayāvishayatves#py aparokshatvād ekāntenāvishayatvābbāvāt tasminn ahankārādyadhyāsa ity arthaḥ. Aparokshatvam api kaiścid ātmano neshṭam ity āsankyāha pratyagātmeti.

p. 6

can be superimposed only on such other objects as are before us, i.e. in contact with our sense-organs; for non-discerning men superimpose on the ether, which is not the object of sensuous perception, dark-blue colour.

Hence it follows that the assumption of the Non-Self being superimposed on the interior Self is not unreasonable.

This superimposition thus defined, learned men consider to be Nescience (avidyā), and the ascertainment of the true nature of that which is (the Self) by means of the discrimination of that (which is superimposed on the Self), they call knowledge (vidyā). There being such knowledge (neither the Self nor the Non-Self) are affected in the least by any blemish or (good) quality produced by their mutual superimposition [^fn_48]. The mutual superimposition of the Self and the Non-Self, which is termed Nescience, is the presupposition on which there base all the practical distinctions--those made in ordinary life as well as those laid down by the Veda--between means of knowledge, objects of knowledge (and knowing persons), and all scriptural texts, whether they are concerned with injunctions and prohibitions (of meritorious and non-meritorious actions), or with final release [^fn_49].

But how can the means of right

[^fn_48]: 6:1 Tatraivaṁ sati evambhūtavastutattvāvadhāraṇe sati. Bhā. Tasminn adhyāse uktarītyā#vidyāvmake sati. Go. Yatrātmani buddhyādau vā yasya buddhyāder ātmano vādhyāsaḥ tena buddhyādinā#tmānā va kr̥tenā#śanayādidosheṇa caitanyaguṇena cātmānātmā vā vastuto na svalpenāpi yujyate. Ānanda Giri.

[^fn_49]: 6:2 Whether they belong to the karmakāṇḍā, i.e. that part of the Veda which enjoins active religious duty or the jñānakāṇḍa, i.e. that part of the Veda which treats of Brahman.

p. 7

knowledge such as perception, inference, &c., and scriptural texts have for their object that which is dependent on Nescience [^fn_50]?

Because, we reply, the means of right knowledge cannot operate unless there be a knowing personality, and because the existence of the latter depends on the erroneous notion that the body, the senses, and so on, are identical with, or belong to, the Self of the knowing person. For without the employment of the senses, perception and the other means of right knowledge cannot operate. And without a basis (i.e. the body [^fn_51]) the senses cannot act. Nor does anybody act by means of a body on which the nature of the Self is not superimposed [^fn_52]. Nor can, in the absence of all that [^fn_53], the Self which, in its own nature is free from all contact, become a knowing agent. And if there is no knowing agent, the means of right knowledge cannot operate (as said above). Hence perception and the other means of right knowledge, and the Vedic texts have for their object that which is dependent on Nescience. (That human cognitional activity has for its presupposition the superimposition described above), follows also from the non-difference in that respect of men from animals. Animals, when sounds or other sensible qualities affect their sense of hearing or other senses, recede or advance according as the idea derived from the sensation is a comforting or disquieting one. A cow, for instance, when she sees a man approaching with a raised stick in his hand, thinks that he wants to beat her, and therefore moves away; while she walks up to a man who advances with some fresh grass in his hand. Thus men also--who possess a higher intelligence--run away when

[^fn_50]: 7:1 It being of course the function of the means of right knowledge to determine Truth and Reality.

[^fn_51]: 7:2 The Bhāmatī takes adhishṭḥānam in the sense of superintendence, guidance. The senses cannot act unless guided by a superintending principle, i.e. the individual soul.

[^fn_52]: 7:3 If activity could proceed from the body itself, non-identified with the Self, it would take place in deep sleep also.

[^fn_53]: 7:4 I.e. in the absence of the mutual superimposition of the Self and the Non-Self and their attributes.

p. 8

they see strong fierce-looking fellows drawing near with shouts and brandishing swords; while they confidently approach persons of contrary appearance and behaviour. We thus see that men and animals follow the same course of procedure with reference to the means and objects of knowledge. Now it is well known that the procedure of animals bases on the non-distinction (of Self and Non-Self); we therefore conclude that, as they present the same appearances, men also--although distinguished by superior intelligence--proceed with regard to perception and so on, in the same way as animals do; as long, that is to say, as the mutual superimposition of Self and Non-Self lasts. With reference again to that kind of activity which is founded on the Veda (sacrifices and the like), it is true indeed that the reflecting man who is qualified to enter on it, does so not without knowing that the Self has a relation to another world; yet that qualification does not depend on the knowledge, derivable from the Vedānta-texts, of the true nature of the Self as free from all wants, raised above the distinctions of the Brāhmaṇa and Kshattriya-classes and so on, transcending transmigratory existence. For such knowledge is useless and even contradictory to the claim (on the part of sacrificers, &c. to perform certain actions and enjoy their fruits). And before such knowledge of the Self has arisen, the Vedic texts continue in their operation, to have for their object that which is dependent on Nescience. For such texts as the following, 'A Brāhmaṇa is to sacrifice,' are operative only on the supposition that on the Self are superimposed particular conditions such as caste, stage of life, age, outward circumstances, and so on. That by superimposition we have to understand the notion of something in some other thing we have already explained. (The superimposition of the Non-Self will be understood more definitely from the following examples.) Extra-personal attributes are superimposed on the Self, if a man considers himself sound and entire, or the contrary, as long as his wife, children, and so on are sound and entire or not. Attributes of the body are superimposed on the Self, if a man

p. 9

thinks of himself (his Self) as stout, lean, fair, as standing, walking, or jumping. Attributes of the sense-organs, if he thinks 'I am mute, or deaf, or one-eyed, or blind.' Attributes of the internal organ when he considers himself subject to desire, intention, doubt, determination, and so on. Thus the producer of the notion of the Ego (i.e. the internal organ) is superimposed on the interior Self, which, in reality, is the witness of all the modifications of the internal organ, and vice versā the interior Self, which is the witness of everything, is superimposed on the internal organ, the senses, and so on. In this way there goes on this natural beginning--and endless superimposition, which appears in the form of wrong conception, is the cause of individual souls appearing as agents and enjoyers (of the results of their actions), and is observed by every one.

With a view to freeing one's self from that wrong notion which is the cause of all evil and attaining thereby the knowledge of the absolute unity of the Self the study of the Vedānta-texts is begun. That all the Vedānta-texts have the mentioned purport we shall show in this so-called Śārīraka-mīmāṁsā [^fn_54].

[^fn_54]: 9:1 The Mīmāṁsā, i.e. the enquiry whose aim it is to show that the embodied Self, i.e. the individual or personal soul is one with Brahman. This Mīmāṁsā being an enquiry into the meaning of the Vedānta-portions of the Veda, it is also called Vedānta mīmāṁsā.
