39. And on account of the impossibility of rulership (on the part of the Lord).

The Lord of the argumentative philosophers is an untenable hypothesis, for the following reason also.

Those philosophers are obliged to assume that by his influence the Lord produces action in the pradhāna, &c. just as the potter produces motion in the clay, &c. But this cannot be admitted; for the pradhāna, which is devoid of colour and other qualities, and therefore not an object of perception, is on that account of an altogether different nature from clay and the like, and hence cannot be looked upon as the object of the Lord's action.
