36. On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications (in the case of the higher castes) and on account of their absence being declared (in the case of the Śūdras).

That the Śūdras are not qualified, follows from that circumstance also that in different places of the vidyās such ceremonies as the upanayana and the like are referred to. Compare, for instance, Śat. Br. XI, 5, 3, 13, 'He initiated him as a pupil;' Cḥ. Up. VII, 1, 1, 'Teach me, Sir! thus he approached him;' Pra. Up. I, 1, 'Devoted to Brahman, firm in Brahman, seeking for the highest Brahman they, carrying fuel in their hands, approached the venerable Pippalāda, thinking that he would teach them all that.'--Thus the following passage also, 'He without having made them undergo the upanayana (said) to them' (Cḥ. Up. V, 11, 7), shows that the upanayana is a well-established ceremony [^fn_229].--With reference to the Śūdras, on the other hand, the absence of ceremonies is frequently mentioned; so, for instance, Manu X, 4, where they are spoken of as 'once born' only ('the Śūdra is the fourth caste, once-born'), and Manu X, 126, 'In the Śūdra there is not any sin, and he is not fit for any ceremony.'

[^fn_229]: 227:1 The king Aśvapati receives some Brāhmaṇas as his pupils without insisting on the upanayana. This express statement of the upanayana having been omitted in a certain case shows it to be the general rule.
