7. And (the case of the term avyakta) is like that of the term mahat.

While the Sānkhyas employ the term 'the Great one,' to denote the first-born entity, which is mere existence  [^fn_236](? viz. the intellect), the term has a different meaning in Vedic use. This we see from its being connected with the Self, &c. in such passages as the following, 'The great Self is beyond the Intellect' (Ka. Up. I, 3, 10); 'The great omnipresent Self (Ka. Up. I, 2, 23); 'I know that great person' (Śve. Up. III, 8). We thence conclude that the word avyakta also, where it occurs in the Veda, cannot denote the pradhāna.--The pradhāna is therefore a mere thing of inference, and not vouched for by Scripture.

[^fn_236]: 252:1 The commentators give different explanations of the Sattāmātra of the text.--Sattāmātre sattvapradhānaprakr̥ter ādyapariṇāme. Go. Ān.--Bhogāpavargapurushārthasya maha_kkh_abditabuddhikāryatvāt purushāpekshitaphalakāraṇaṁ sad ucyate tatra bhāvapratyayo#pi svarūpārtho na sāmānyavācī kāryānumeyaṁ mahan na pratyaksham iti mātraśabdaḥ.
