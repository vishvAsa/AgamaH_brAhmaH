13. And it is minute.

And the chief vital air is to be considered as minute like the other prāṇas.

Here also we have to understand by minuteness that the chief vital air is subtle and of limited size, not that is of atomic size; for by means of its five functions it pervades the entire body. It must be viewed as subtle because when passing out of the body it is not perceived by a bystander, and as limited because scripture speaks of its passing out, going and coming.

But, it may be said, scripture speaks also of its all-pervadingness; so,

e.g. 'He is equal to a grub, equal to a gnat, equal to an elephant, equal to these three worlds, equal to this Universe' (Br̥. Up. I, 3, 22).

To this we reply that the all-pervadingness of which this text speaks belongs to the Self of the prāṇa in its adhidaivata relation, according to which it appears as Hiraṇyagarbha in his double--universal and individual--form, not in its adhyātma relation. Moreover the statements of equality 'equal to a grub,' &c., just declare the limited size of the prāṇa which abides within every living being.

Thus there remains no difficulty.
