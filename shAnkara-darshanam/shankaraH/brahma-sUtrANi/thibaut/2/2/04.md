4. And because (the pradhāna), on account of there existing nothing beyond it, stands in no relation; (it cannot be active.)

The three guṇas of the Sānkhyas when in a state of equipoise form the pradhāna. Beyond the pradhāna there exists no external principle which could either impel the pradhāna to activity or restrain it from activity. The soul (purusha), as we know, is indifferent, neither moves to--nor restrains from--action. As therefore the pradhāna stands in no relation, it is impossible to see why it should sometimes modify itself into the great principle (mahat) and sometimes not. The activity and non-activity (by turns) of the Lord,

on the other hand, are not contrary to reason, on account of his omniscience and omnipotence, and his being connected with the power of illusion (māyā).
