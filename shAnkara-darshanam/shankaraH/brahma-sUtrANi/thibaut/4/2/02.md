2. And for the same reason all (sense-organs) (follow) after (mind).

'Therefore he whose light has gone out comes to a new birth with his senses merged in the mind' (Pr. Up. III, 9); this passage states that all senses without difference are merged in the mind. 'For the same reason,' i.e. because there also as in the case of speech, it is observed that the eye and so on discontinue their functions, while the mind together with its functions persists, and because the organs

themselves cannot be absorbed, and because the text admits of that interpretation; we conclude that the different organs follow after, i.e. are merged in, the mind only as far as their functions arc concerned.--As all organs [^fn_219] without difference are merged in the mind, the special mention made of speech (in SÅ«tra 1) must be viewed as made in agreement with the special example referred to by scripture, 'Speech is merged in mind.'

[^fn_219]: 366:1 I.e. the functions of all organs.
