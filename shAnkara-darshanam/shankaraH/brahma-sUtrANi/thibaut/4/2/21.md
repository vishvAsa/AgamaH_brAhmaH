21. (These details) are recorded by Smr̥ti with reference to the Yogins; and both (Sāṅkhya and Yoga) are Smr̥ti (only).

The rules as to dying by day and so on in order not to return are given by Smr̥ti for the Yogins only. And those two, viz. Yoga and Sāṅkhya are mere Smr̥ti, not of scriptural character. As thus it has a different sphere of application and is based on a special kind of authority, the Smr̥ti rule as to the time of dying has no influence on knowledge based on scripture.--But, an objection is raised, we have such passages as the following one, 'Fire, light, the day, the light half of the month, the six months of the northern progress; smoke, night, the dark half of the month, the six months of the southern progress' (Bha. Gītā VIII, 24; 25); in which though belonging to Smr̥ti we recognise the path of the gods and the path of the fathers just as determined by scripture!--Our refutation, we reply, of the claims of Smr̥ti applies only to the contradiction which may arise from the teaching of Smr̥ti regarding the legitimate time of dying. 'I will tell you the time,' &c. In so far as Smr̥ti also mentions Agni and the other divinities which lead on the departed soul, there is no contradiction whatever.
