No one's AchArya is above "comments", including yours and mine. Why? Because they are men, and as with pauruSheya vAkya-s, it becomes important to know the qualities and circumstances of the person producing them.

Plainly, shankara was a double-agent in a game involving buddhists and Astika-s - as with any double agent, you can never be sure whose side he's on. This is apparent from his philosophy.

It is clear from his own admission, that he is interested in foisting nirguNa-brahma-vivarta-vAda on to brahma-sUtra-s, rather than explaining it as it is. (Contrast अध्यासवादं प्रसाध्य - "यथा चायमर्थो वेदान्तानां तथा वयमस्यां शारीरकमीमांसायां प्रदर्शयिष्यामः" with R's "तन्मतानुसारेण सूत्राक्षराणि व्याख्यास्यन्ते"). It's a hopeless task, and the fraud is apparent by the second sUtra itself. It's akin to dressing up a monkey like a man, and hoping no one will notice.

Why did he get this itch? He could have stopped at adhyAsya-bhAShya (the introductory part), which is a perfectly respectable, if flawed, philosophical piece. Some possibilities -


- He had attachment to vaidika-s, but was also attached to gauDapAda (who explicitly, comically, needed to clarify - "तथा ज्ञानं नैतद्बुद्धेन भाषितम्  ॥ ४.९९ ॥" in his kArika extension). So, he had to convince himself, most of all, that his vivartavAda is vaidika.
- Another guess is that he was so into "अध्यास" that he just could not resist doing it on to BS and laughing at all those who fall for it.
- parakAla yati & varadAchArya thought that it was a subversive operation against buddhists (ie. he himself did not believe in what he was writing), but that seems very unlikely.
