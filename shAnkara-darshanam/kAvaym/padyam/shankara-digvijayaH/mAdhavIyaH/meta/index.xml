Hegde&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Advaita Academy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[[0:00]] foreign [Music] [[0:27]] welcome everybody the very famous debate between shankaracharya and Mandana [[0:33]] Mishra the debate between a staunch Advent and a very staunchaka [[0:42]] this debate this episode occurs in many hedgeographies of [[0:48]] shankaracharya and there are many many hedgeographies of shankaracharya so I [[0:54]] will primarily rely on the madhavi ashankara and the chip velasia to an [[1:01]] extent in this discussion at the outset I want to say that I will be [[1:06]] sidestepping questions of historical accuracy of this episode my approach to [[1:13]] texts is usually academic especially if the text is [[1:18]] abstract philosophy but this text is not that I personally believe that history [[1:25]] is not the correct lens through which we must read this type of work because the [[1:31]] purpose of these higiographies is not historical accuracy in the way that we [[1:37]] understand today I like what SRI aurobindo said in this context [[1:42]] in the context of the category of itihasa in India he said that itihasa [[1:49]] encompasses the historic and the a historic together he wrote The Poets who [[1:56]] wrote and those who added to these great bodies of poetic writing wrote with a [[2:01]] sense of their function as Architects and sculptors of life [[2:07]] so any literary account of any thinker of India [[2:12]] assumes the form of a living commentary on the truths that he verbalized that he [[2:19]] preached in his works so these hedgeographies they try to show [[2:25]] that the truth claimed by the acharya was lived embodied and realized by him [[2:32]] they tried to show that his life reflected the truths that he taught so [[2:38]] they established the connection between knowledge and way of living the two must [[2:44]] go hand in hand this is very important so these hedgeographies function as a [[2:50]] narrative commentary of a philosophical position it is this that is highlighted [[2:56]] in the text it is this that must be reflected upon when we read the hey geographies so questions like did this [[3:03]] incident truly occur did it occur in the way that it is described there are many [[3:09]] variations of the story in different higiographies so which one is correct so [[3:15]] these questions are truly irrelevant so I&amp;rsquo;ll sidestep them entirely [[3:21]] my point is simply this these hair geographies serve a purpose even if they [[3:28]] are not necessarily based on historical evidence in the modern sense of the term that is [[3:35]] all but this as an introduction we can look directly into the text [[3:42]] is dated between 1650 to 1800 CE [[3:48]] at the end of each of its chapters its colorful drinks it is [[3:54]] so the author of this work is [[3:59]] while many believe that this is the same who later became the famous monk [[4:06]] vidyaranya his claim is not established it is disputed there are many reasons to [[4:13]] contest this claim be that as it may the author of this work is [[4:21]] the author refers to his work asaya [[4:27]] and in his writes [[4:39]] so this text essentially brings together skillfully material from several earlier [[4:46]] hedgeographies it&amp;rsquo;s a late work 17th 18th century far [[4:55]] removed from shankaracharya so it is necessary has to Cull material from [[5:01]] different geographies from earlier hit geographies it weaves these together in [[5:06]] a beautiful narrative primarily it Chronicles shankaracharya&amp;rsquo;s [[5:12]] now big Vijaya is originally a term for Imperial military conquest or expansion [[5:19]] literally it means a conquest of the eight directions the eight quarters the [[5:26]] Sham vitayaha so a conquest of the world is of course not a military conquest it [[5:34]] is an intellectual conquest of the different regions of India it&amp;rsquo;s not a [[5:39]] conquest by battle but by debate by words not words by sastra [[5:46]] so this episode of his debate with Mandana Mishra occurs in the eighth [[5:51]] circle of this text we can look into the details the scene unfolds like this&#xA;Shankaracharya&amp;rsquo;s meeting with Kumarilabhatta for a Vartika on his Bhashya [[5:58]] shankaracharya had written his bhashya on the brahmasutras and he wished that [[6:03]] one of the greatest Scholars of the time kumarilla bhatta write a varthika a [[6:09]] gloss for his partial so to make this request with him [[6:14]] shankaracharya reaches prayag to meet kumarilla to request him to write a [[6:20]] varthika on his worship foreign [[6:43]] [Music] [[6:56]] means [[7:11]] is collected made into a pile and Saturn fire this was a form of capital [[7:18]] punishment meted out to hardened criminals dry straw was twisted around [[7:25]] the limbs of the criminal and it was set on fire so that he burns a very slow a [[7:31]] very torturous depth until we have Kumari lapatta Seated on burning [[7:37]] tusharashi he&amp;rsquo;s surrounded by his illustrious [[7:44]] disciples like prabhakaramishra who are watching their teacher die a very slow [[7:50]] and a very painful death with tears streaming down their eyes yeah [[8:03]] now the fire has already burnt has already engulfed the lower half of [[8:08]] kumarena&amp;rsquo;s body yet amidst that smoke amidst that fire [[8:14]] that has engulfed him only his face is seen radiant fresh like a Lotus blooming [[8:22]] in the Mist Paris foreign [[8:39]] subjecting himself to capital punishment for Christ for atonement for the [[8:47]] expiration of three sins that he committed discusses the three sins in quite some [[8:54]] detail in the text but in the interest of time I&amp;rsquo;ll take only one of it if you watched Sanskrit movie on [[9:01]] shankaracharya you will know this story because the movie followed this text [[9:07]] very closely it made a lot of effort to avoid any [[9:12]] deviations from this story so if you&amp;rsquo;ve watched the movie you know the story but I&amp;rsquo;ll still be some some accepts from the [[9:19]] text so what is this sin that kumarilla has committed he explains&#xA;Kumarilabhatta philosophical debates with the Buddhists [[9:35]] witnessing Buddhism spreading very quickly conquering every corner [[9:44]] is Buddha so [[9:50]] and witnessing the dwindling number of vaidikas [[9:58]] witnessing this [[10:09]] but unfortunately he was unable to win any philosophical debate with the with [[10:15]] the Buddhists he lost every debate with them repeatedly continuously primarily [[10:22]] because he was unfamiliar with their philosophy [[10:29]] so he decided to disguise himself as a Buddhist enter their Monastery and learn [[10:37]] Buddhism formally so that ultimately he can defeat them in philosophical debates [[10:43]] and re-establish the Primacy of The Vedas now while in Disguise in the Buddhist [[10:52]] Monastery he had to constantly listen to The Vedas being criticized being [[10:59]] severely abused by the Buddhist monks [[11:05]] and this for him was torturous unable to Bear the pain his eyes shed involuntary [[11:14]] tears the text says [[11:19]] and these tears they gave him away the Buddhist monks realized that kumarilla [[11:26]] bhatta is not a true Buddhist because a true Buddhist will not shed tears for [[11:32]] The Vedas as a punishment for his [[11:37]] deceits decided to throw him off a cliff the text reads [[11:49]] so the monks caught him dragged him to the top of the cliff and together they [[11:57]] literally threw him off the cliff literally pushed him to his death [[12:02]] or so they thought because at this moment when he was thrown off the cliff while [[12:10]] he was falling to his death literally to hit rock bottom kumarilla shouted [[12:18]] if The Vedas are true let no harm befall me yet [[12:28]] and he lived he remained unharmed to fall from one of the tallest Cliffs did [[12:34]] not break his bones not a single scratch on his body because he had vowed yet [[12:47]] and this this is why kumarilla is performing [[12:53]] because he said if The Vedas are true let no harm before [[13:01]] the use of the word if [Music] [[13:09]] the word if expresses a doubt it is [[13:19]] almost casting aspersions on its validity he should have said May the [[13:24]] true Vedas protect me no he said if The Vedas are true let no harm the follow me [[13:31]] and this for him is an unforgivable transgression and to atone for this sin [[13:39]] he is on that slow burning to his death [[13:44]] if this seems I don&amp;rsquo;t know uh outrageous or a disproportionate punishment for [[13:52]] what may be a minor transgression if that we would do well to remember that [[13:58]] our ancestors have faced far worse conditions to safeguard The Vedas to [[14:05]] have protected The Vedas to have passed on The Vedas for at least a couple of [[14:10]] thousand years without any errors in transmission they have given their life [[14:15]] for it and this here is a small illustration of that level of dedication [[14:22]] that level of Faith the absolute surrender to The Vedas that has [[14:27]] protected this country anyway coming back to the story kumarilla because he is himself unable [[14:35]] to fulfill shankaracharya&amp;rsquo;s request he is unable to write a varthika for his [[14:41]] bhashia he directs him to his disciple Mandana Mishra&#xA;Why did Kumarila direct Shankara to Mandana Mishra [[14:46]] foreign [[14:58]] foreign [[15:24]] you win him in an argument you have won everybody [[15:34]] and when you have defeated him in he will write that for your passion [[15:42]] so shankaracharya stayed with Kumari lapatta until his end and then left to [[15:49]] mahishmati to meet mantana Mishra according to the madhaviya and the [[15:55]] vyasachalia lives in mahishmati according to the [[16:02]] chid velasia he lived in Kashmir the details of the kumarla episode is also slightly different in the philasia be [[16:10]] that asset me mahishmati shankaracharya had no trouble finding&#xA;Finding Mandana&amp;rsquo;s house [[16:17]] Mandana mishra&amp;rsquo;s house the text treats like this [[16:33]] are birds like Paris so where parrots are debating the swathak of The Vedas at [[16:41]] the entrance of the house know that house [[17:00]] [Music] or requires the intervention of ishwara [[17:06]] nor that house [[17:20]] where parents are debating if the world is eternal or non-eternal [[17:30]] nor that house to be Mandana mishra&amp;rsquo;s so shankaracharya arrived at mantana&#xA;Śaṅkara-Maṇḍana banter [[17:37]] mishra&amp;rsquo;s doorstep for his part is not very pleased to [[17:43]] receive shankaracharya primarily because at that moment he was engaged in [[17:50]] performing ceremony and for him an auspicious time like that the sight of a shaven-headed [[17:58]] sannyasi is inauspicious so their very first exchange is very unpleasant [[18:05]] Mandana is irritable shankaracharya is amused and a very witty conversation [[18:12]] follows Mundi where did you come from you [[18:18]] shaven-headed fellow shankaracharya playfully twists the [[18:23]] meaning of these words he takes [[18:29]] how far is your head shaven it&amp;rsquo;s a play of words it&amp;rsquo;s funny so shankaracharya [[18:35]] humorously replies to this I&amp;rsquo;m shaving up to the neck Mundi [[18:44]] that is not what I asked I asked you where you have come from I asked your way [[18:53]] playfully twists the words again he says you asked the way what did the way say [[19:03]] ing replies it&amp;rsquo;s said that your mother is a widow [[19:10]] foreign [[19:37]] the banter continues like this and the conversation turns very personal very bitter bandana says you fake sannyasi [[19:45]] for you sannyasa is simply loafing around with a bundle of books and a band [[19:50]] of disciples for you sannyasa is simply the inability to feed your family the [[19:56]] inability to shoulder your responsibilities foreign [[20:31]] because of your desire to eat good food without having to work for it [[20:43]] says what is you have just taken the Garb of a [[20:48]] ritualist because of your desire for women foreign [[21:18]] says enough of this meaningless banter I did [[21:23]] not come here for a vikra I came here for a Vada picture [[21:31]] and my only condition of this debate this father is that the one who loses [[21:37]] must accept the philosophy of the other and become his disciple [[21:48]] for his part is very happy to hear this he&amp;rsquo;s happy to accept a challenge so he [[21:54]] replies I will not hesitate to accept a challenge even if abhishesha the summit of [[22:02]] learning himself challenges me with his thousand tongues [[22:13]] foreign so the two agree to a debate together&#xA;Rules of the Debate [[22:20]] they start the rules for the debate [[22:26]] in a debate there should be two parties meeting in an argument and we are the [[22:31]] two parties there must be a proposition for which [[22:38]] are against which the arguments are directed [[22:48]] it has to be fixed how success or defeat is to be determined and what the [[22:53]] consequence of such success or defeat should be that&amp;rsquo;s also the question of who the [[23:01]] judge should be for the debate so let us fix these beforehand so we can start the [[23:06]] debate in the best of spirits with a smile on our faces and this is what they did they decided [[23:13]] to start the debate early next morning they decided that [[23:18]] mishra&amp;rsquo;s wife will be the judge for the debate in this text [[23:23]] is the is understood as the Incarnation of goddess Saraswati herself cursed by [[23:30]] Sage durbasa to take a human birth so she is to be the church and so [[23:37]] everything is decided everything is set everything is fixed [[23:42]] at dawn at sunrise shankaracharya having completed his abductions with his [[23:50]] disciples reached mandana&amp;rsquo;s house where several learned Scholars had already [[23:57]] assembled to watch the debate furthermore Brahma and the devadas had [[24:03]] assembled to witness this historic moment and bharti adorned the seat of [[24:10]] judgment like goddess Saraswati herself at the outset shankaracharya stated his&lt;/p&gt;</description>
