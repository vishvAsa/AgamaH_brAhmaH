      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-book&#34;&gt;The Book&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A biography of Sri Sankara on modern lines is an impossible for want of exact data from contemporary writings. We have therefore to depend on the type of Sanskrit works called Sankaravijayas, the traditional lives of the Acharya, to know whatever is now possible to gather about this saintly philosopher who has left so vivid an impression on the Indian mind. As these Vijayas have a mythological bias, they have their obvious defect in respect of chronology and recording of facts and events, but they got their excellences too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prefatory Remarks&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-17) 1. Offering my prostrations to Sri Vidyatirtha (my Guru), who is one with the Self of all, I am attempting to give here a clear and precise summary of the ancient literature connected with the glorious life of Acharya Sankara (or of the book named Purasankarajaya). 2. In a small mirror, even the big forehead of an elephant can be clearly seen. Even so, in this, my brief work, you will get the essence of all the extensive accounts about Sankara and his teachings. 3. The intensely enjoyable taste of sweetness is enhanced by the intervention of other tastes. Similarly, my literary endeavour, however defective, will only enhance the delectableness of what ancient poets have written on the subject. 4. May the great commentator Sankara accept the offering of my poesy even amidst the vastly superior writings on him by poets of old. For, did not Lord Mahavishnu, though living in the midst of the milk ocean, yearn for the milk offered to Him by the milkmaids of Vrindavana? 5. The great world teacher Sankara defeats even the thousand-tongued Adisesha by the sweet and constant flow of his words resembling a perennial spring in the nectar ocean. I am attempting to narrate the most delectable excellences of that world teacher-the great Sankara of transcending greatness and goodness. 6. Where is the glory and greatness of Sri Sankara, which, in a subtle fashion, spreads everywhere like the fragrance of jasmine flower, transcending the barriers of space and time, and where am I, a creature of very little powers and talents? In spite of this disparity, I am attempting this unequal task only because of my faith in the support of the merciful look of benediction that my Guru has bestowed on me. 7. By using my literary talent in this way, I am cleansing it in the waters sanctified by the glories of the Lord, and thus ridding it of the dirt it has accumulated through its deployment in the praise of mean and proud men whom wealth&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sankara&amp;rsquo;s Parents&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-5) God Siva, the self-created and merciful Being, the destroyer of Cupid, manifested himself as His holy emblem, usually called Sivalingam, on a hill known as Vrishachala situated near the course of the river Purna in the Kerala country. Coming to know of the divinity and greatness of that Sivalingam through a dream, a king called Rajasekhara built a fine temple to house the Lingam and made arrangements for its worship. In that region there was a prosperous village settlement of Brahmanas known as Kaladi. In that village lived a learned and pious Brahmana by name Vidyadhiraja, as whose grandson the divine manifestation of the great God Siva, the resident of the temple of Vrishachala, was to take place in due time. As a fruition of the piety and good fortune of Vidyadhiraja, a son named Sivaguru was born to him. He did very well justify his name, as he grew to be like Siva in know- ledge and like Guru or Brihaspathi, the teacher of the Gods, in his power of speech:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Antecedents of Mandana&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-8) While God Siva, the crescent-crested, thus took birth on earth, many other Divinities also embodied themselves as off- spring in the houses of learned Brahmana scholars. Mahavishnu was born as the son of a learned Brahmana named Vimala and came to be known as Padmapada (having in early life the name of Sanandana), before whom no scholar could keep up his reputation for scholarship. The deity Vayu took birth as the son of the fanati- cal ritualist Prabhakara under the name of Hastamalaka who always humbled the pride of his opponents. By a tenth of his being, the deity of Fire became Totaka, the sea of whose reputation was deep enough to drown the earth and whose mission was to pulverize the arguments of all opponents who faced him. Totaka, the terror of his antagonists, was known in his early life as Údanka, the son of Silada. Brahma was born as Mandana (known in his early life as Viswarupa), Ganesa as Anandagiri, and Varuna as Chitsukha. Some hold that Sanandana, who is the same as Pad- mapada, was an incarnation of Aruna and not of Vishnu as stated earlier. Many other Devas also were born as the sons of learned Brahmanas in order to be of service to the Lord in his world- saving mission. There is also a view that Mandana (described earlier as a manifestation of Brahma) was Brihaspati, the teacher of the gods, who was cursed in anger by Brahma for writing the text of the philosophy of materialism known after Charvaka; also that Anandagiri was the incarnation of Nandi, the bull of Siva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>04 BOYHOOD DAYS UP TO THE AGE OF EIGHT</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sankara as a Precocious Boy&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-20) Within his first year this child, who was God Siva embodied as the son of these Brahmana parents, showed himself proficient in languages. By the second year, he could recite all books and showed an untaught mastery of Kavyas and Puranas. Hearing once, he could learn anything, and so, he not only gave the least trouble to the teacher on his own account, but relieved him from much of his burdens by offering to teach his fellow students. Being free from Rajas and Tamas even from his days as a playful child, he soon became the master of all learning. Now after his tonsure ceremony, he shone like a sacrificial fire into which ghee offerings have been poured. Wonder of wonders! Without any instruction this boy was to master all the four Vedas with their auxiliary branches of learning, besides literature and the tough subjects of logic and sound reasoning. Excelling even the Guru of the Devas in his power of speech, he was to out-distance and silence all the proud scholars of the place. By the flow of words from his mouth, astonishing even Adisesha, he was destined to silence all debaters who faced him. Before his powerful criticism that would pulverize the teachings of spurious sects, the upholders of such doctrines were to find themselves helpless. Sivaguru, his fortunate father, felt his family blessed and its reputation enhanced by this son who equalled the sun itself in the brilliance of his body and mind. But Sivaguru was not destined to see the full development of the genius of his son. For, he passed away suddenly when the boy was only three years old and thoughts about his Upanayana were just cropping up in his mind. Alas! death makes no distinction between the good and the bad. The birth of a son in a family is sometimes a rarity, and of a talented son much more so. Having got such a talented son, and that after much prayer and austerities, Sivaguru was not fortunate enough to see the glorious efflore- scence of his genius.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reputation of Boy Sankara attracts the King&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-9) Thus at the age of seven that wonderful child, having spanned the ocean of Vedic learning, left the house of the Guru and returned home to pay his respect to his mother. Thenceforth he spent his time quietly at home, engaging himself in the service of his mother, in studying the Veda and in offering oblations in the sacred fire twice a day along with observing all allied rituals. The very sight of that boy could rid young men of their impa- tience and aggressiveness. Even an aged man would feel inclined to get up in his presence and offer him a seat, and no man could help saluting him respectfully at the very sight. And the mother, too, felt overjoyed to see in her son a combination of rare virtues -power of speech, great intelligence, tendency to do good and great personal attractiveness. One day that lady, whose body had become weak by fasts and other ascetic observances, happened to fall down exhausted, as she went in the burning sun to take her bath in the river Purna, which was at some dis- tance from her home. Anxious at his mother&amp;rsquo;s condition, the young boy managed to get her back home with the help of several neighbours and restore her to consciousness by adopting appropriate remedial measures. Afterwards in order to make the river Purna easily accessible to his mother, he addressed an invocatory prayer to the deity presiding over it, requesting her to turn her course to the neighbourhood of their home. The river deity was pleased to grant the prayer, and the very next morning people were all surprised to see that the ocean-bound stream had changed its course and was flowing through the neighbourhood of that home like another Ganga, refreshing the whole village with the cool breeze wafted along its broad surface.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Advent of Sanandana alias Padmapada&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-15) One day a Brahmana, learned in Vedas and of handsome and commanding appearance, went to see the Acharya and pay his respects to him. Being full of the spirit of renunciation and free from the bondage of a home and a spouse, he came to the Acharya and fell at his feet, recognising in him a seaworthy boat of a Guru that could help him cross this turbulent ocean of Samsara. Raising up the prostrating, devotee, the Acharya said: &amp;ldquo;Who are you? Where do you come from? What is the purpose that emboldens you to approach me thus? Though you are young in years, you seem to be old in wisdom, Though alone, you seem to have the boldness of a crowd.&amp;rdquo; The wise newcomer said in reply: &amp;ldquo;I am a Brahmana belonging to the Chola country where flows the great river Kaveri, whose waters have got the unique power of producing devotion in the minds of men who drink of it. I am going round the country to meet men of spiritual illumination, and in the course of my travels, arrived here recently. O merciful one! Deign to help me, sinking in the ocean of Samsara, to reach the shore of safety across it. Out of mercy, for this weeping destitute, deign to pour the nectar-like rain of thy gracious looks on him. If thou hesitatest, pondering over my worthiness or otherwise for thy grace, thou wilt lose thy reputation for boundless grace, for grace is not conditioned by considerations of merit. The reputation one gains for mercy and kindness through liberality to the poor and the suffering cannot be had by making presents to the rich and the opulent. Men do not even notice a cloud that rains continuously for years in the midmost ocean, while they eagerly look for the clouds that bring at least a shower to a desert region. Permit me to bathe in the high-tide of thy instructions, in the nectar-ocean of thy wisdom, and thereby develop in myself the conviction; &amp;ldquo;This life of Samsara is petty and worthless, being devoid of Brahmic bliss and contaminated by the baneful influence of ignorance which generates evil passions and&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sankara in Confrontation with Sage Vyasa&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-21) Once, seated on the banks of the Ganga, the Acharya was teaching his commentaries to his disciples till late in the noon. Finding the disciples exhausted, the Acharya closed the session and got up, when he was confronted by an old Brahmana with the question: &amp;ldquo;What are you teaching, Sir? And may I know who you are?&amp;rdquo; Thereupon the disciples intervened and said: &amp;ldquo;This is our teacher, the great Acharya Sankara, the master of all the Upani- shads, who has established the doctrine of Non-dualism through his commentaries on Särīraka-sutras (Brahma-sutras).&amp;rdquo; The Brahmana thereupon remarked: “O Sannyasin teacher, this seems unbelievable. These people say that you have commented on the Sutras of Vyasa. If you are as learned as that, let me hear you expound any one Sutra of Vyasa.&amp;quot; &amp;ldquo;My salutation to all exponents of the Sutras!&amp;rdquo; replied Sankara, &amp;ldquo;I do not claim to be a master of the Sutras. Still, if you question me on them, I shall try to answer to the best of my knowledge.&amp;rdquo; The Brahmana thereupon quoted the first Sutra (tadantarapratipattau ramhati sampariṣvaktaḥ prašna- nirūpaṇābhyām) from the third chapter of Brahma-sutras, and asked Sankara to explain it. To this Sankara replied: &amp;ldquo;In the light of the conversation between Gautama and Jabali in the Thandila-sruti, this Sutra means that at the time of death the Jiva departs clothed in the subtle essence of the Bhutas or elements.&amp;rdquo; The learned Brahmana then raised numerous objec- tions to this interpretation to the utter astonishment of all the scholars assembled there. Thereupon Sankara answered the criti- cisms and attacked the thesis of the Brahmana in several ways. Thus, the conversation turned into a learned disputation extending over eight days between these two, who resembled Adisesha and Brihaspati in learning. When the two were thus engaged in this prolonged debate, Padmapada, who got an inkling of the identity of the new-comer, said at last: &amp;ldquo;This Brahmana is none other than that very Vyasa, the knower of the essence of all Vedantas and the author of these Sutras. He is an incarnation of Mahavishnu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;towards-mahishmati-to-meet-mandana&#34;&gt;Towards Mahishmati to meet Mandana&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-13) Bhagavan Sankara now left Prayaga, and travelling through the skies, reached the splendid city of Mahishmati which had gained great reputation as the residence of Mandana. Admi- ring the beauty and splendour of the numerous buildings of the city, he descended from the skies even like the sun at the close of the day, in a lovely wooded park of that place. There his physical exhaustion was assuaged by a gentle breeze coming through palm groves, carrying the cool water particles from the extensive sheets of lotus-flowers that covered its lakes. Finishing his morning rites and after resting a while, he started for Mandana&amp;rsquo;s place along the road, before it was noon. On the way he met a number of maidservants going to fetch water in pots for use at Mandana&amp;rsquo;s house. When he asked them for directions to find out Mandana&amp;rsquo;s house, these women, wonder-struck at the sight of the imposing personality of Sankara, replied very respectfully: &amp;ldquo;You will find nearby a house at whose gate there are a number of parrots in cages, discussing topics like this: &amp;lsquo;Has the Veda self-validity, or does it depend on some external authority for its validity? Are Karmas capable of yielding their fruits directly, or do they require the intervention of God to do so? Is the world eternal, or is it a mere appearance?&amp;rsquo; Where you find the strange phenomenon of caged parrots discussing such abstruse philosophical problems, know 1 Mandana Misra is known by several names. He is known also as Oomveka, and as Viswarupa, besides as Sureswara after he became a Sannyasin under Sankara&amp;rsquo;s influence. Probably Mandana Misra was the name by which he was known among scholars, while Viswarupa was the name given to him by his parents, and Oomveka, a pet name. His early history has already been described in Canto 3. It is to be noted that there is a well-known Vedantic text by name Brahmasiddhi, attributed to Mandana Misra. Whether this Mandana is the same as the ritualistic philosopher whom Sankara had to confront, is a matter of controversy, because the views of the author of Brahmasiddhi are mostly Vedantic and not of the ritualistic phi- losophy. It may be that the work is by the same Mandana after he came under the influence of Sankara, but that for some unknown reason his old name came to be attached to the work. But the greater possibility is that the ritualist Mandana [[82]] that to be the gate of Mandana&amp;rsquo;s house.&amp;rdquo; Sankara with his dis- ciples spotted the house, but found its gates closed. So he dropped into the compound from the sky. There he had a total view of the famous scholar&amp;rsquo;s residence which, with its mansions and gardens, resembled the heavenly abode of Indra himself. Entering a towering mansion, he got into the hall where Mandana was seated-Man- dana. famous for his learning and noble qualities, and imposing in appearance like Brahma himself. He saw the scholar washing the feet of the great sages Vyasa and Jaimini, whom he had brought there by the power of his Tapas to grace the occasion of a Sraddha ceremony he was performing that day. On seeing the two great sages, Sankara greeted them, and they, too, wished him in turn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Correct Interpretation of Jaimini&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-3) Though the words of the great Sannyasin, expounding the words of the Veda in such a clear and cogent way, put an end to Mandana&amp;rsquo;s desire for controversy, he still had one doubt uncleared owing to his fanatical devotion to the path of Vedic rituals. He said: &amp;ldquo;O great Sannyasin! Defeat in debate is some- thing new for me. Still it does not depress me. But alas! That the teachings of Jaimini have been refuted, is a matter of great concern for me. Jaimini is one who knew all about the past, present ánd future. He knows the true purport of the Veda. He also stands for the good of all the worlds. How could he, the greatest among ascetics, then formulate a false body of teachings in his Sutras ?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(1-10) Next various propitiatory and auspicious rites were performed by priests for the king&amp;rsquo;s welfare. Then accompanied by his friends and the ministers, the king went in procession on an elephant&amp;rsquo;s back to his city. After pacifying his sorrow-stricken subjects, the king, along with his ministers, ruled the kingdom like Indra over the heavens, receiving the tribute and respect of all feudatory rulers. While the great Sankara began to rule the kingdom through the body of Amaruka, his astute ministers began to feel some doubts about the identity of their master and spoke thus among themselves: &amp;ldquo;It is by the rare good fortune of the people of this land that the king has come back to life. from the jaws of death. But he now looks a changed man. Unlike in earlier days, we find all divine virtues manifest in him. He is now like a Yayati to people who`approach him for favours; in power of speech he is like the Guru of the Devas; to opposing kings he is like the great hero Arjuna; and in learning he is like Siva Himself. We find in him an abundant manifestation of rare qualities -he is unyielding in valour, unperturbed in adversity and unparalleled in liberality. Surely he looks a fragment of Divinity itself. In orchards and wooded groves, trees are bearing flowers and fruits in all seasons. Cows and buffaloes are yielding plentiful milk. Timely rain has resulted in bumper crops. And all people are adhering to the proper discharge of their allotted duties. Though the age of Kali in which we live is an evil age, in this land our king seems to have inaugurated a virtuous age excelling the age of Treta itself. It looks, therefore, that some divine personage has ·&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Kapalika&amp;rsquo;s plea for the Acharya&amp;rsquo;s Head&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-28) One day Sankara, the conqueror of all the passions and the resort of even rishis who have conquered their lower self, was resting at a solitary spot after he had delivered his discourses on the Bhashya. A fierce and cruel-hearted Kapalika now appro- ached him with evil intentions in the guise of an ascetic, even as Ravana did in times of old. Delighted with the thought that his long awaited opportunity had now dawned, he approached the Acharya and curtly told him what he wanted. He said: “Having heard much about your life and about your great qualities like omniscience, mercy, goodness, etc., I have come here to see you in person. You are the universally respected teacher of non- dualism, who has overcome identification with the body, cast away all infatuations, and defeated every form of dualism in debate. You have assumed your body for the good of others. Your fame, even the Devas praise. With your merciful look you remove the sufferings and anxieties of good men. And with your kind words you grant whatever blessings people want. You are the ocean of all virtues. You command the respect of the whole world. Your knowledge has no limits. No one can stand before you in debate. You are without any tinge of ego. You are the supremely liberal one who bestows all you possess on others. Great men of such excellences generally grant to their suppliants whatever prayers they make. I can achieve a great object of mine through an all-knowing one like you and win the grace of my deity, namely, Kapali or Siva sporting a skull in his hand. I performed austerities for a hundred years in order to get a boon from Siva, which would enable me to attain to Kailasa with this very physical body and enjoy the felicity of that heavenly region with this body itself. Lord Siva, being propitiated, declared to me: &amp;lsquo;Your object will be fulfilled if you can perform a sacrifice, offering in fire the head of either a crowned king, or in the alternative, of an all-knowing person.&amp;rsquo; Ever since then I have been in quest of these, but I have till now failed to get the head of either a king or an all-knowing person. Fortunately, I have today come across an omniscient personage who lives only&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Acharya at Gokarna&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-5) Once, while the Acharya was travelling with his disciples from one pilgrimage to another, the party arrived at the holy spot of Gokarna on the sea-shore. The Acharya worshipped there at the shrine of Siva, who is the divine director of this stage of the world, who is adored by Brahma and all the gods, and who has His consort Parvati on the left side of His body. He sang a hymn of praise as follows: &amp;ldquo;I meditate on the form of Siva, the destroyer of Cupid, whose right side is illumined by His own radiance of sky-like whiteness and the left by the lighting-like brilliance of His consort Parvati who shares the left half of His body (in his Ardhanariswara form). In this combined form of Siva-Parvati, the hand of the Siva-half is shivering because of movements of the deer in it, as the deer leans to nibble at the grass- like beams of brilliance proceeding from the Devi-half; and the left arm of the Devi-half is also in turn shivering, as the parrot in that hand is struggling to peck at the corn-like bunches of brilli- ance coming from the Siva-half. This manifestation of Divine Radiance, in which the forbidding darkness of the poisonmark on Siva&amp;rsquo;s neck is neutralised by the mellow light of the Mangalya- sutra on the Devi&amp;rsquo;s neck-with this Radiance I am one in Non-dual Consciousness.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing of an Exegesis on Sutra-bhashya&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-21) One day Sureswara, desirous of writing some exegesis on his Master&amp;rsquo;s great commentary on the Säriraka-bhāshya, approached him and said: &amp;ldquo;O great teacher! Please tell me how I could help you in your mission. To live in the service of his teacher is the only desirable form of life for a disciple.&amp;rdquo; Glad at the disciple&amp;rsquo;s request, Sankara said to him: &amp;ldquo;You may write for my commentary a vārtikam (an exegesis giving a critical exposi- tion).&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;I am not equipped enough to have a comprehensive understanding of your great commentary,&amp;rdquo; said Sureswara, “yet, if I have your grace, I shall try to do as you have ordered.&amp;quot; After he had departed to fulfil his teacher&amp;rsquo;s command, some of the disciples approached their teacher and began to warn him thus: &amp;ldquo;This effort of Sureswara, in place of helping the propagation of your message, may have a contrary effect. Was he not, till the other day, a great upholder of the philosophy of ritualistic Karma? He, as Mandana, had been preaching that ritualistic Karma giving the fruit of heaven is the message of the Veda, and that there is no God other than Karma. All Puranas speak of the creation and destruction of the worlds as a real process. Vyasa was the author of all these Puranas, and Jaimini, the founder of ritualistic philo- sophy, was the disciple of this Vyasa. The world and its processes are real-says the doctrine supported by both Vyasa and Jaimini. For, between the disciple and his teacher, there can be no difference in view, and even if there is, the teacher&amp;rsquo;s is the Siddhanta (the thesis on the doctrine), and the disciple&amp;rsquo;s but a modification of it. Such were the views he held as Mandana. From his birth he has been following and preaching the ritualistic code, which holds that all doctrines, differing from the view that the attainment of heavenly felicities through the performance of Vedic rituals is the highest end of life, are worthless. O great teacher! An exegesis that a person with such views writes on your works, be it with your permission, is bound to be a perversion of your commentaries; for, it will have Vedic ritualism as its dominant keynote. It will be like applying the axe at one&amp;rsquo;s own roots. Getting defeated in&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>14 THE PILGRIMAGE OF PADMAPADA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Rationale of Pilgrimage&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-19) Once Padmapada approached the Acharya and sought permission to go on a pilgrimage to holy places. The Acharya thereupon said to him, &amp;ldquo;The proximity of the Guru is the real place of pilgrimage. The washings of his feet are the holy waters. The attainment of the Atman through the Guru&amp;rsquo;s instruction is the real experience of the Holy Presence which men seek indirectly through the adoration of holy images installed in temples. It is better to be near the Guru, serving him, than go about from place to place. When one has walked long distances and become com- pletely exhausted and sleepy, how can one meditate on the Atman? Sannyasa is of two kinds-the first is of the knowing one, and the second, of the enquirer after the Supreme Truth. In order that they might realise the unity of the &amp;lsquo;Thou&amp;rsquo;, indicating the Jiva, with the Supreme Spirit indicated by &amp;lsquo;That&amp;rsquo;, the enquirers will have always to be reflecting on the meaning of &amp;ldquo;Thou&amp;rsquo;. This will be difficult for a pilgrim to do; for, a traveller will always have his mind agitated by thoughts such as: &amp;ldquo;In which place is water avail- able in abundance? In which country is there water scarcity? Where can a place for rest and stay be had? What will one do if afflicted with fever or dysentery? Even one&amp;rsquo;s companions will desert one when one becomes incapacitated by illness to walk or to lie down. Where shall I bathe in the morning? Where shall I get a place suited for worship and meditation? Where shall I get my food today? Where shall I meet a companion?&amp;rdquo; Thus, the wanderer will have time only to think of his food, shelter and safety.&amp;rdquo; To this Padmapada replied: &amp;ldquo;It is not proper to raise objections to the Guru&amp;rsquo;s words. Still, I have a word to say. Though the Guru&amp;rsquo;s proximity is equal to residence in a holy place, I feel a mental dissatisfaction for not having visited the different holy places. True, difficulties like want of food and facilities of accom- modation will face one. But pray, will living with all conveniences of life enhance one&amp;rsquo;s spiritual stature? Diseases are the result of one&amp;rsquo;s sins of the past. If this be true, they will visit one irrespective of whether one stays in one place or wanders about from place to&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Confrontation with Kapalikas in Karnataka&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-23) Now Acharya Sankara, along with the king Sudhanya and a large number of disciples, started on a Dig-vijaya-a mis- sionary tour for the propagation of the Advaita doctrine by con- troverting all philosophies opposed to it. He first travelled towards the Setu. On his way, he came across a sect whose followers were externally Saivas, but drank liquor in their worship like the Saktas. He entered into a very heated debate with these Brahmanas of Sakta persuasion, silenced them in argument for the good of the world, and made them accept the right code of rituals that he formulated. After worshipping Ramanatha at Rameswaram, the Acharya travelled through the Pandya and Chola countries and reached the city of Kanchi which shone like an ornament to the Hasti ranges. There he built a temple, instituted the worship of Devi, with rituals that are in accordance with the Vedic traditions and suited to the attainment of supreme knowledge. He eschewed, in those rituals, every trace of the Tantrika modes of worship.1 Next, blessing the people of Andhra country and worshipping Lord Venkatanatha, he reached the land of Vidarbha. He was given a cordial reception by the king of that place. There, Padma- pada and other disciples engaged themselves in controverting the perverse doctrines of the Bhairavas. After a time, the Acharya started towards the Karnataka country, but was warned by the king of Vidarbha that those regions were very dangerous, as they were full of Kapalikas who were followers of the cult of human sacrifice who condemned the Vedic religion and were, on the whole, a curse to humanity. They were not likely to tolerate the spread of the Acharya&amp;rsquo;s influence in those regions. Hearing this warning,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>16 ACCESSION TO SHARADAPITHA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Navagupta&amp;rsquo;s Black Magic&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1-8) Navagupta, the master of black magic, was, as stated before, planning, ever since his defeat at the hands of Sankara, to bring about his death by black magic. By Abhichara (a form of black magic) this evil one produced in the body of the Acharya a rectal fistula of an incurable nature. The disciple Totaka always nursed his teacher and, washed and cleansed his cloth stained with blood and faecal matter that flowed through the fistula, which yielded to no treatment. One day, all the disciples together represented to their sick Master thus: &amp;ldquo;The occurrence of a disease cannot perhaps be prevented altogether; but if it is not arrested by treatment, it will grow into menacing proportions like an unchecked enemy. As you have no identification with the body, you may not be very mindful of these developments. But we, who see all your sufferings, are all extremely griefstricken. There are many expert physicians who can diagnose the nature of the disease and administer efficient treatment. Let us find out a proper physician to do the necessary treatment for you. The Sastras say that even if a teacher is careless about his bodily comforts owing to his indifference to the body, nonetheless, it is the obligation of dutiful disciples to do everything to relieve him and look after his comforts. Your happi- ness is our happiness. Your feet are our only support in life. We are, therefore, very much concerned for your recovery from these sufferings.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
