      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shastriji always used to tell his followers that, it was difficult for him to put into words whatever thought that flowed in his mind while going through Yōgavāsiṣṭha as every word or a phrase or a sloka would push him to non doing state. Due to repeated requests from his close associates, he agreed to speak on a few topics in Yōgavāsiṣṭha. The recorded talks which were highly disjointed have been put into a readable format after much deliberation. The reader is requested to keep this in mind and absorb the essence of teaching.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I HAVE DRAWN LESSONS FROM YŌGAVĀSIṢṬHA. Whatever is detailed out in the Upanishads is repeated here, as you must have seen by now. It is not possible for me to see anything other than what is in Upanishads. There is a huge repetition. Every second line in Yōgavāsiṣṭha talks about cetya versus cit. Any chapter, any sloka you see it is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;चेत्योनुसंधान रहितम् चिन्मात्रम्&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;cētyōnusaṁdhāna rahitam cinmātram.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;चेत्यानुपात रहितम् चिन्मात्रम्&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After dealing on the aspect of attaining a state of vairagya Yōgavāsiṣṭha opens with the idea of the importance of sravana and manana and goes on to describe the aspect of creation. Sage Vasishta however asserts that a true saadhaka has to concentrate more on the ways and means of getting out of the cycle of birth and death rather than think about the how and why of creation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shastriji opens his talk on the need to do manana and dwells very briefly on the aspect of creation as to how we are capable of creation when we are in the dream phase. He gives pointers to the inward journey in the path of saadhana. So, the inward journey is vital in the spiritual progress of every individual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(SEVEN DESCENDING STEPS OF IGNORANCE)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a detailed account on the play and control of the mind, sage Vasishta explains the seven states of ignorance, Saptapadām and also the seven states of ascent to wisdom, Saptabhūmikām. The first seven attempts are to clearly define the path to be avoided and the next seven are ascending paths to be nurtured leading one to the attainment of liberation from the shackles of life. It should not be literally taken as the stges one has to pursue to attain libeation. It is purely a guide or a marker to show where a sadhaka stands in his path of sadhana.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(SEVEN ASCENDING STATES OF WISDOM)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AFTER GIVING DETAILED ACCOUNT OF SWAROOPA IN different ways Yogavasishta takes up the discussion on the aspect of sapta bhoomika, the seven steps or stages of evolvement of a peson. We will try to know about these seven steps in the path of yoga sadhana or svaroopa praapti, knowing ourselves. How these steps can be identified and adopted in the process of saadhana is the subject matter of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WE WILL TAKE UP A CHAPTER FROM UPASHAMA prakarana from Yōgavāsiṣṭha for our discussion and deliberate. The chapter is that of Prahlada.The purpose of our study is limited to the saadhana part and we are not interested in the story as such. How the text deliberates on the aspect of liberation and search for ‘Self’ is more important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an interesting story of Prahlaada who is an established Vishnu bhakta and his bhakti, devotion was of that order that whenever he thought of the Lord, the Lord would appear before him. He notices that his mind is absolutely at peace and serene during the hours of worship. Subsequent to this he observes that his mind getting unsettled – किंचित् डोलायितम् मनः - kiṁcit ḍōlāyitam manaḥ, mind is disturbed a little. Although he is fine and peaceful, there is still unrest in some corner of the mind. There is an oscillation and he tries to ask his Master Vishnu for a solution. He was having doubts about mystery of creation. Even devotion to God cannot give us paramaśānti – परमशान्ति, eternal bliss as there is some mystery which does not get solved. In the blank hours after pooja, he starts thinking about this status as what is “he”? What is the purpose or goal of this life? Such questions come to all of us. Imagine the plight of a सात्विक् - sātvik, a pious man, who is unable to solve doubts about the aspect of creation during his leisure hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HERE IS A CHAPTER WHICH SHOWS THE GROWTH OF spiritual level until one touches nirvana levels in the path of sadhana or even attain the state of jeevanmukti. Jeevanmukti is a concession to the position of nirvana. When a jeevanmukta winds up, whatever is the state of self or soul is nirvana, or liberation, never to get into the cycle of birth and death as sampradaya puts it. Of course I have an extreme view of mukti, being daring and radical. I would say why we should even bother or think about mukti or think of coming out of the cycle of life and death!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To attain purushaartha, one has to give up ahankaara. The only way to do that is to control the chattering and outgoing mind which is solely responsible for all the misery.Shastriji concludes his lecture series, by dwelling on this aspect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Editor&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;अस्य संसार दुःखस्य सर्वोपद्रवकारिण:,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;उपाय एक एव अस्ति मनसः स्वस्थ निग्रहः.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;asya saṁsāra duḥkhasya sarvōpadravakāriṇaḥ,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;upāya ēka ēva asti manasaḥ svastha nigrahaḥ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Y.V.4-4-1)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;F&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OR THE SORROW CAUSED BY THE TORMENTING worldly life, there is only one cure and that is the control of one’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
